      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>The honey bee head is a compact toolkit for perception and manipulation. It carries the compound eyes and ocelli for vision, antennae for smell, taste, touch, and humidity sensing, and a versatile set of mouthparts for gathering liquids, sculpting wax, and processing food. Inside, specialized glands and a highly efficient brain integrate sensory input with learned experience. Understanding this region helps explain why bees navigate so well, how they assess nectar quality, and what you are seeing when a bee
