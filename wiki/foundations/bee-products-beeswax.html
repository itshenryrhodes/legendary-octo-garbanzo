    <section id="what-is-beeswax">
      <h2>What is beeswax?</h2>
      <p>Beeswax is a biologically produced, lipophilic material secreted by worker honey bees and shaped into comb. It functions as the colony’s structural fabric—housing brood, pollen, and honey—and as a dynamic surface that modulates temperature, humidity, vibration, and chemical cues. Fresh wax is nearly white; as it absorbs propolis resins and food pigments it deepens through pale yellow to golden and, in brood areas, to brown.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Melt range:</strong> roughly 62–65 °C (144–149 °F); softens well below the melt point.</li>
        <li><strong>Density:</strong> ~0.95 g/cm³; it floats on water and will stratify above honey during rendering.</li>
        <li><strong>Chemistry:</strong> primarily long-chain esters, hydrocarbons, and free fatty acids that confer pliability and hydrophobicity.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="how-bees-make-wax">
      <h2>How bees make wax</h2>
      <p>Young worker bees (typically 12–18 days old, depending on colony needs) secrete wax scales from eight paired abdominal glands. Producing wax is energy intensive; bees convert dietary sugars into wax precursors, so colonies draw comb best when nectar is abundant or when light feeding supplies a steady carbohydrate stream.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Secretion:</strong> translucent scales (~3 mm) form under the abdominal plates.</li>
        <li><strong>Manipulation:</strong> workers pluck scales with the hind legs, pass them to the mandibles, and mix in minute amounts of saliva and propolis.</li>
        <li><strong>Placement:</strong> wax is pressed, kneaded, and extended into sheets; heat from clustered builders (~35 °C/95 °F) keeps wax workable.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Comb arises as a living scaffold: bees prefer to extend sheets downward from a starter edge, maintaining bee space (about 6–9 mm) between parallel surfaces.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="comb-geometry">
      <h2>Comb geometry and function</h2>
      <p>Comb consists of back-to-back arrays of hexagonal cells that share walls, minimizing material while maximizing storage and brood area. The slightly <em>tilted</em> cell angle (a few degrees upward) helps retain nectar. Worker and drone cells differ in diameter; brood areas darken as cocoons and traffic stain the wax. Over time, cell diameter narrows and disease spores can accumulate—one reason to cycle out old brood comb on a schedule (see <a href="/wiki/operations/comb-replacement.html">Replacing Old Comb</a> — planned).</p>
    </section>

    <section id="roles-of-wax">
      <h2>Roles of beeswax in the colony</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Brood rearing:</strong> thermally stable cradles for larvae and pupae.</li>
        <li><strong>Food storage:</strong> capped honey and bee bread protected from moisture and pests.</li>
        <li><strong>Information layer:</strong> substrate for pheromones and vibration signals (e.g., waggle dance).</li>
        <li><strong>Mechanical layout:</strong> partitions that define traffic lanes, queen movement, and worker task zones.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="encouraging-drawing">
      <h2>Encouraging bees to draw comb</h2>
      <p>Comb building is most reliable when energy intake, temperature, and space cues align. Combine the following to help colonies draw straight, usable comb:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Timing:</strong> add frames or supers just ahead of a strong nectar flow, or simulate a light flow with small, steady syrup feeds (see <a href="/wiki/operations/feeding-basics.html">Feeding basics</a>).</li>
        <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> maintain brood nest warmth and reduce drafts; crowded builders generate the heat needed to work wax.</li>
        <li><strong>Guides:</strong> use wired wax foundation, foundation sheets in plastic frames, or starter strips (see <a href="/wiki/operations/comb-guide-strips.html">Using Comb Guide Strips</a> — planned).</li>
        <li><strong>Placement:</strong> intersperse one undrawn frame between two fully drawn frames to encourage straight drawing; don’t place too many empties at once in a weak nectar period.</li>
        <li><strong>Space:</strong> keep correct frame spacing; too-wide gaps invite brace and burr comb.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Foundationless approaches can yield beautiful, all-wax comb when flows are strong and hives are level; they require attentive management to prevent cross-combing.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="troubleshooting">
      <h2>Troubleshooting common wax problems</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Won’t draw new frames:</strong> flow is weak, colony understrength, or hive is too cool. Consolidate bees, reduce excess space, and feed modestly until conditions improve.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-comb:</strong> lack of guides or tilting hive; correct level, insert spacers, and cut/straighten while comb is young and pliable.</li>
        <li><strong>Burr/bridge comb:</strong> excessive gaps or misaligned frames; correct spacing, scrape, and return frames flush with neighbors.</li>
        <li><strong>Slumped comb:</strong> heat plus weak attachment; ensure solid support (wires, vertical support) when moving fresh combs in hot weather.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="foundation-options">
      <h2>Foundation and frame options</h2>
      <p>Beekeepers can choose among several frame/foundation systems, each with trade-offs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Wired wax foundation in wooden frames:</strong> natural feel and easy acceptance; requires careful storage and wiring to prevent sag.</li>
        <li><strong>Plastic frames or plastic foundation:</strong> durable, consistent cell pattern; acceptance improves with high-quality wax coating and strong flows.</li>
        <li><strong>Foundationless wooden frames:</strong> lowest material cost and fully recyclable; requires strong flows and careful manipulation to keep comb straight.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Match the approach to your climate, nectar flows, transport, and whether you plan to extract with high-speed spinners (which favor reinforced comb).</p>
    </section>

    <section id="hygiene">
      <h2>Comb age, hygiene, and replacement</h2>
      <p>Comb in brood nests accumulates residues—cocoons, propolis, spores, agricultural chemicals—and cell diameters slowly shrink. Many beekeepers rotate out a portion of dark brood comb each year, replacing it with fresh foundation or starter frames to maintain hygiene and productive cell size (see <a href="/wiki/operations/comb-replacement.html">Replacing Old Comb</a> — planned). Keep a simple frame-marking system (e.g., colored tacks or year codes) to track comb age.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="rendering">
      <h2>Rendering and cleaning beeswax</h2>
      <p>Rendered wax comes primarily from cappings, brace comb, and culled frames. Clean wax is safer to reuse and more valuable for candles or cosmetics.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Collect &amp; drain:</strong> after extraction, let cappings drain overnight; store in breathable bags.</li>
        <li><strong>First melt:</strong> use a double boiler or solar melter; never direct-flame beeswax. Add a little water to trap sugars and sediment.</li>
        <li><strong>Filter:</strong> strain molten wax through paint strainers or cloth; avoid overheating which can darken or ignite wax.</li>
        <li><strong>Set &amp; scrape:</strong> allow cakes to cool; scrape the dirty underside (slumgum) before a second melt.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>For step-by-step, see <a href="/wiki/operations/wax-rendering.html">Wax Rendering and Storage</a> (planned) and <a href="/wiki/operations/uncapping-and-filtering.html">Uncapping and Filtering Honey</a> (planned).</p>
    </section>

    <section id="storage">
      <h2>Storing foundation and wax</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cool, dry, dark:</strong> minimize heat deformation and UV degradation.</li>
        <li><strong>Pest prevention:</strong> protect drawn comb from wax moths using freezing cycles or controlled storage; keep rendered wax sealed to exclude moths and rodents.</li>
        <li><strong>Label lots:</strong> track production source and date to manage quality and traceability.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="contaminants">
      <h2>Residues, adulteration, and quality</h2>
      <p>Wax can accumulate lipophilic residues (some miticides, agricultural chemicals). Using off-label chemicals or reusing old contaminated comb increases risk of brood problems and queen issues. Buy foundation from reputable suppliers, favor cappings wax for cosmetic uses, and avoid adulterated wax (e.g., paraffin blends) which softens comb and fails during extraction. If in doubt, test a sample or trial a small batch before installing across many hives.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="economics-uses">
      <h2>Economics and common uses</h2>
      <p>Wax is a valuable co-product. Clean, light cappings wax commands premium prices. Common uses include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Beekeeping:</strong> foundation coating, baiting plastic frames for acceptance.</li>
        <li><strong>Candles &amp; crafts:</strong> high melt quality, pleasant aroma, clean burn.</li>
        <li><strong>Food prep:</strong> cheese coatings, baking wraps, and finishes (ensure food-grade sources).</li>
        <li><strong>Cosmetics &amp; wood care:</strong> salves, lip balms, furniture polish (use clean, filtered wax).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A small-scale operation can trade cappings wax for new foundation or sell direct to hobbyists.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="safety">
      <h2>Safety notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fire risk:</strong> beeswax is flammable; always use a double boiler or indirect heat. Keep a lid and class-K or multipurpose extinguisher nearby.</li>
        <li><strong>Food contact:</strong> if using wax for foods or cosmetics, keep rendering equipment clean and dedicated to wax only.</li>
        <li><strong>Ventilation:</strong> avoid inhaling heated wax fumes; work in well-ventilated areas.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="practical-steps">
      <h2>Practical steps for the apiary</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Before a major flow, insert one undrawn frame between two drawn frames per box; add a super just as the prior box reaches 70–80% drawn.</li>
        <li>Use starter strips in foundationless frames when a flow is humming; keep boxes level and avoid jostling frames until comb is well attached.</li>
        <li>Mark frames with the year they were drawn; plan to remove the darkest brood combs annually.</li>
        <li>After extraction, save cappings separately; render in batches and filter twice for clean cakes.</li>
        <li>Store drawn comb cool and moth-safe; store wax sealed and labeled by lot.</li>
      </ol>
