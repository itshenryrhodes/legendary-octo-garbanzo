      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p><strong>Apiary</strong> (noun): A site where one or more managed beehives are kept under the care of a beekeeper. The term refers to the physical location and its arrangement, not to a single hive. Apiaries can be permanent (a “home yard”) or temporary/seasonal (for pollination or nectar flows).</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Plural:</strong> apiaries</li>
        <li><strong>Related terms:</strong> bee yard, bee site, out-yard, home yard, mating yard</li>
        <li><strong>Not the same as:</strong> “hive” (a single colony/unit) or “colony” (the superorganism of bees living in a hive)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="purpose">
      <h2>What an apiary is for</h2>
      <p>An apiary concentrates colonies where forage, water, and access make management efficient. The site is selected to balance bee needs (sun, shelter, flight paths) with human needs (safety, legal compliance, neighbors, workflow). Good apiary selection reduces swarming pressure, winter losses, robbing, and conflicts, and it improves honey production and inspection quality.</p>
      <p>New beekeepers often start with a small home apiary of two to four hives, then expand to multiple out-yards as experience and equipment grow. Commercial operators may run dozens of apiaries dispersed across different forage zones.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="components">
      <h2>Typical components of an apiary</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hives &amp; stands:</strong> Boxes elevated to keep floors dry and to set flight lines above walking height. (See <a href="/wiki/foundations/hive-types-overview.html">Hive types overview</a>.)</li>
        <li><strong>Clear flight paths:</strong> Unobstructed, predictable bee traffic away from people, pets, and livestock.</li>
        <li><strong>Water source:</strong> Clean, reliable water close to the hives to limit nuisance visits to pools or stock troughs. (See <a href="/wiki/habitat/planting-for-pollinators.html">Planting for pollinators</a> for habitat context.)</li>
        <li><strong>Windbreak/shelter:</strong> Hedges, fences, or terrain that buffer cold winds without deep shade.</li>
        <li><strong>Work space:</strong> A flat, safe area around each stand for lifting, placing supers, and staging tools.</li>
        <li><strong>Access &amp; security:</strong> Vehicle access for moving equipment, plus gates/signage to discourage disturbance.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage &amp; hygiene:</strong> Covered space or totes for spare equipment, and a plan for wax cappings and comb to avoid robbing.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="site-criteria">
      <h2>Core site criteria (at a glance)</h2>
      <p>Apiary siting is covered in depth in <a href="/wiki/operations/apiary-layout-basics.html">Apiary layout basics</a>. The high-level checklist:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sun &amp; shade:</strong> Morning sun to start flights early; avoid full-day scorch in hot climates.</li>
        <li><strong>Drainage:</strong> Well-drained soil; avoid frost pockets and standing water.</li>
        <li><strong>Forage:</strong> Diverse, season-long nectar and pollen within ~3 km; reduce competition where possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Water:</strong> Provide or ensure nearby, stable water to prevent nuisance foraging.</li>
        <li><strong>Flight lines:</strong> Orient entrances away from pathways and property lines; use screens/fences to lift flight paths.</li>
        <li><strong>Access:</strong> Year-round access for inspections, feeding, and harvest without rutting fields or disturbing livestock.</li>
        <li><strong>Neighbors &amp; safety:</strong> Distance from play areas, stock pens, and public rights-of-way; maintain good relations (see <a href="/wiki/operations/first-inspection-checklist.html">First inspection checklist</a> for calm handling practices).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="types">
      <h2>Types of apiaries</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Home yard</dt>
        <dd>A beekeeper’s primary site, often near a workshop or residence for frequent checks and overwintering.</dd>

        <dt>Out-yard</dt>
        <dd>Secondary site placed for a specific bloom or microclimate; fewer visits between major tasks.</dd>

        <dt>Mating yard</dt>
        <dd>Arranged for queen rearing with drone-saturated areas and nuc stands; usually more sheltered and accessible.</dd>

        <dt>Pollination placement</dt>
        <dd>Temporary apiary placed near a crop; access, water, and spray coordination are critical.</dd>
      </dl>

    <section id="management">
      <h2>Managing an apiary vs. managing a hive</h2>
      <p>Hive management focuses on brood pattern, stores, Varroa, and queen status. <em>Apiary</em> management operates one level up: optimizing the site so individual colonies can thrive with less intervention.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Spacing &amp; density:</strong> Enough lateral space to lift supers and reduce drifting; avoid long, uniform rows without landmarks.</li>
        <li><strong>Landmarks &amp; colors:</strong> Visual cues and varied entrance angles reduce drifting and robbing.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonal layout:</strong> Shift weak colonies to sunnier, calmer spots; keep production colonies where forage and access align.</li>
        <li><strong>Equipment flow:</strong> A standard place to set smokers, tools, and full supers keeps work safe and efficient. (See <a href="/wiki/foundations/hive-tool-basics.html">Hive tool basics</a>.)</li>
        <li><strong>Biosecurity:</strong> Separate zones for suspect hives; close comb storage to deter wax moths; tidy up honey spills.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Because bees navigate by the sun, landmarks, and odors, small layout tweaks can markedly change drifting and traffic conflicts. Thoughtful apiary management pays back every visit.</p>

    <section id="seasonality">
      <h2>Seasonality in apiaries</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Spring buildup:</strong> Add space early to reduce congestion and swarming pressure; ensure water is in place.</li>
        <li><strong>Summer flow:</strong> Keep paths clear for heavy lifting and ventilation; stage supers where you can lift ergonomically. (See <a href="/wiki/operations/feeding-basics.html">Feeding basics</a> and <a href="/wiki/operations/winter-prep-checklist.html">Winter prep checklist</a> for bookends.)</li>
        <li><strong>Autumn prep:</strong> Consolidate equipment, check windbreaks, and remove burr comb that attracts robbing.</li>
        <li><strong>Wintering:</strong> Favor dry, sheltered positions; entrances free of vegetation and snow; consider shielding from prevailing winds.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="people">
      <h2>People, neighbors, and signage</h2>
      <p>Apiaries exist among people, pets, and property. Good neighbor relations minimize complaints and call-outs.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Set expectations:</strong> Explain flight paths, peak activity times, and water source location.</li>
        <li><strong>Screening:</strong> Fences or hedges lift bee traffic above head height and soften sight lines.</li>
        <li><strong>Signage:</strong> Clear, polite signs: “Managed bees at work—please keep distance.” Include contact details where appropriate.</li>
        <li><strong>Allergies &amp; access:</strong> Keep paths obvious; avoid placing entrances toward shared gates or yard equipment.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Where rules apply, an apiary may need registration or minimum setbacks; check the <a href="/wiki/community-policy/apiary-registration.html">Apiary Registration Requirements</a> and local ordinances when selecting a site.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="scale">
      <h2>Scaling apiaries</h2>
      <p>As hive count grows, the site’s weak points show: narrow gates, muddy ruts, or too little morning sun. Two strategies help:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Split capacity:</strong> Rather than crowding one yard, open a second out-yard closer to alternative forage.</li>
        <li><strong>Standardize the layout:</strong> Reuse the same stand spacing, pallet orientation, and work zones so every yard “feels” the same.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Standardization reduces errors and speeds training for helpers. It also makes record-keeping and inventory movements clearer (which super belongs where, which frames were cycled, etc.).</p>
    </section>

    <section id="troubleshooting">
      <h2>Common apiary problems &amp; quick fixes</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Drifting and uneven performance</dt>
        <dd>Break up rows with landmarks; vary entrance angles; use colors/patterns on alighting boards.</dd>

        <dt>Chronic robbing</dt>
        <dd>Reduce entrances during dearth, clean spills immediately, and maintain distance between weak and strong colonies.</dd>

        <dt>Water nuisance</dt>
        <dd>Place attractive water (shallow, warm, textured landing) closer than pools or stock troughs; refresh often in heat.</dd>

        <dt>Wind exposure</dt>
        <dd>Install windbreaks or shift stands behind natural shelter; strap hives and level to prevent lid lift.</dd>

        <dt>Access in wet seasons</dt>
        <dd>Gravel approaches, ground protection mats, or seasonal access plans prevent rutting and stuck vehicles.</dd>
