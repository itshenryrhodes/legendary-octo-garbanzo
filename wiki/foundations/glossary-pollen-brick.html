      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p><strong>Bee bread</strong> is pollen that foragers collect from flowers and workers then process by mixing with small amounts of nectar or honey and salivary enzymes. The mixture is compacted into comb cells and lightly sealed with a thin layer of honey. Over days, microbes in the stored mixture drive a mild, largely lactic fermentation that stabilizes and preserves nutrients. Bee bread is the colony’s principal <em>protein</em> and <em>lipid</em> store for feeding larvae and young workers (nurse bees).</p>

    <section id="how-made">
      <h2>How bees make it</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Pollen collection:</strong> Foragers brush pollen from their bodies into <em>corbiculae</em> (pollen baskets) on the hind legs and moisten granules with nectar to make cohesive pellets.</li>
        <li><strong>Transfer &amp; packing:</strong> In the hive, foragers pass pellets to house bees or deposit them directly. Workers tamp the pollen into cells using rhythmic head and thorax motions, excluding air pockets.</li>
        <li><strong>Enzymes &amp; inoculation:</strong> Saliva contributes enzymes (e.g., amylases, proteases) and a microbial starter. Nectar/honey provides sugars to fuel fermentation.</li>
        <li><strong>Cap with honey:</strong> A thin honey film creates a partial oxygen barrier, limiting spoilage and encouraging lactic-acid–leaning microbes.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The result is a dense, layered deposit with a slightly tangy aroma and darker color than raw pollen pellets.</p>

    <section id="why-it-matters">
      <h2>Why bee bread matters</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Nutrient availability:</strong> Fermentation modestly predigests pollen walls and proteins, improving digestibility for larvae and nurse bees.</li>
        <li><strong>Balanced diet:</strong> It supplies essential amino acids, fatty acids, sterols, vitamins, and minerals needed for gland development and brood food production.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonal buffer:</strong> Stored bee bread bridges gaps when fresh pollen is scarce, supporting steady brood rearing.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="composition">
      <h2>Composition (typical ranges)</h2>
      <p>Bee bread varies by floral source and season, but commonly contains:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Proteins &amp; amino acids:</strong> ~10–25% dry matter, including essential amino acids (isoleucine, valine, leucine, etc.).</li>
        <li><strong>Lipids:</strong> ~1–10% (fatty acids and sterols important for cell membranes and hormone precursors).</li>
        <li><strong>Carbohydrates:</strong> From added nectar/honey and pollen starches; fuel for metabolism and fermentation.</li>
        <li><strong>Vitamins &amp; minerals:</strong> B-complex vitamins, vitamin C traces, potassium, magnesium, iron, and trace elements.</li>
        <li><strong>Bioactives &amp; phytochemicals:</strong> Pigments and antioxidant compounds that vary widely by plant source.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Because composition depends on plant diversity, colonies near diverse forage typically produce higher-quality bee bread.</p>

    <section id="bee-bread-vs-honey">
      <h2>Bee bread vs. honey</h2>
      <p><strong>Bee bread</strong> is protein- and fat-rich and feeds developing bees and nurses. <strong>Honey</strong> is carbohydrate-dense and serves mainly as an energy store for all castes, particularly over winter. Both are essential but serve distinct roles; neither substitutes perfectly for the other.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="use-in-colony">
      <h2>How the colony uses bee bread</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Nurse bees</strong> consume bee bread to fuel hypopharyngeal and mandibular glands, producing jelly for larvae and the queen.</li>
        <li><strong>Larvae</strong> indirectly receive bee bread nutrients via brood food; older larvae may receive tiny amounts of bee bread particles mixed in.</li>
        <li><strong>Workers</strong> of different ages tap bee bread when their tasks demand higher protein (e.g., wax production, wound repair, immune challenges).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="quality">
      <h2>Quality indicators and risks</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Good bee bread</strong> is tightly packed, slightly moist, aromatic (not sour or musty), and capped with a thin honey film.</li>
        <li><strong>Poor quality</strong> may be indicated by chalky dryness, visible mold threads, or strong off-odors. Bees often avoid contaminated cells.</li>
        <li><strong>Single-source dependence:</strong> Heavy reliance on a narrow floral window (monoflora) can reduce amino acid balance; diversity usually helps.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="management-tips">
      <h2>Practical management tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Favor diverse forage:</strong> Plant or encourage a mix of species to diversify pollen profiles. See <a href="/wiki/habitat/planting-for-pollinators.html">Planting for pollinators</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Mind robbing and pests:</strong> Avoid prolonged open feeding of pollen or patties that can attract robbing and beetles.</li>
        <li><strong>Rotate old comb:</strong> Very old comb can accumulate residues; rotating frames over time helps maintain food quality.</li>
        <li><strong>Supplement carefully:</strong> If natural pollen is scarce, use quality pollen supplement/patty according to label and remove uneaten patties to prevent beetle or mold problems.</li>
        <li><strong>Leave enough stores:</strong> Do not harvest frames containing significant bee bread during critical brood-rearing periods.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="harvest-use">
      <h2>About harvesting bee bread</h2>
      <p>Some beekeepers remove small amounts for analysis or specialty products. Bee bread is laborious to extract, and over-harvesting may stress colonies by reducing protein reserves. If harvested, do so sparingly and outside periods of intense brood rearing.</p>

    <section id="faq">
      <h2>Quick answers</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Is bee bread the same as raw pollen?</dt>
        <dd>No. Raw pollen is collected pellets; bee bread is pollen that has been packed, mixed with nectar/honey and enzymes, and lightly fermented in cells.</dd>

        <dt>How long does bee bread keep in the comb?</dt>
        <dd>Weeks to months, depending on moisture, temperature, microbial balance, and a protective honey cap. Bees will preferentially consume fresh deposits first.</dd>

        <dt>Can bees raise brood without bee bread?</dt>
        <dd>Not reliably. Colonies require adequate protein and lipids for brood food. Without bee bread (or fresh pollen/suitable substitute), brood rearing declines.</dd>
