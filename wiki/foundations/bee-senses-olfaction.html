    <section id="overview">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Smell is the honey bee’s primary sense for navigating the chemical world. With thousands of odor receptors on their antennae and sophisticated neural circuits, bees can discriminate floral scents, learn new odors quickly, and broadcast information through pheromones. Odors guide foragers to rewarding flowers, help workers recognize nestmates, and regulate colony-level processes such as queen presence, brood care, and defense. Understanding how bees use olfaction helps beekeepers manage hives gently, set up apiaries to reduce drifting, and troubleshoot issues like queen loss or robbing.</p>

    <section id="anatomy">
      <h2>Olfactory anatomy: antennae and sensilla</h2>
      <p>Each bee has a pair of <a href="/wiki/foundations/glossary-antenna.html">antennae</a> specialized for chemical detection. Along the flagellum are numerous <em>sensilla</em>—tiny hair-like structures that house receptor neurons. Key types include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Placodea (sensilla placodea):</strong> Disc-shaped pores packed with odorant receptor neurons (ORNs). These dominate bee olfaction and respond to complex floral bouquets and pheromones.</li>
        <li><strong>Basiconica and trichodea:</strong> Peg- and hair-like sensilla that detect volatile compounds and, in some cases, humidity or temperature, which can modulate odor perception.</li>
        <li><strong>Coeloconica:</strong> Pit-like sensilla implicated in acids and amines detection; they may contribute to alarm and brood-related cue sensing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Odor molecules enter through nanoscopic pores and bind to odorant-binding proteins in the sensillum lymph. These ferry molecules to receptor proteins on the ORN membranes, triggering electrical signals. Axons from ORNs project into the antennal lobe of the brain, where they synapse in discrete <em>glomeruli</em>. There, local neurons sharpen contrast and create odor “maps” before information travels to higher centers (the mushroom bodies for learning and memory, and the lateral horn for innate responses).</p>
    </section>

    <section id="learning">
      <h2>Odor learning and memory</h2>
      <p>Bees are exceptionally fast associative learners. A forager can learn to link a novel floral odor with nectar reward in just a few trials. This pairing forms short-term memory within minutes and, with repetition, consolidates into long-term memory lasting days or more. In field conditions, bees integrate odor with color, shape, and spatial context, but olfaction often drives the initial attraction and final confirmation at the flower.</p>
      <p>Back at the hive, returning foragers carry the floral scent on their bodies and in regurgitated nectar. During a waggle dance, the air near the dancer becomes enriched with that odor, priming recruits to search for similar scents along the advertised direction. Thus, odor <em>labels</em> the foraging target while the dance gives a vector. See also <a href="/wiki/foundations/bee-communication.html">Bee communication</a> (published) and the planned deep dive on dance language.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="pheromones">
      <h2>Pheromone families and what they do</h2>
      <p>Pheromones are chemical signals produced by one bee that change the behavior or physiology of others. Honey bee social life is organized by a suite of pheromones with distinct sources and effects:</p>

      <h3 id="queen-pheromones">Queen mandibular and footprint pheromones</h3>
      <p>The queen’s mandibular gland blend spreads via contact and trophallaxis, signaling her presence and reproductive status. It suppresses worker ovary development, stabilizes the worker retinue, and modulates swarming. Footprint pheromones deposited as she walks can mark comb areas for egg-laying or influence worker attention. When queen signal drops (e.g., queenless state or poor distribution in a large colony), workers may start emergency queen rearing or behave restlessly. For more, see the planned <a href="/wiki/foundations/bee-queen-workers-behavior.html">Queen Pheromones and Worker Responses</a>.</p>

      <h3 id="brood-pheromone">Brood pheromone</h3>
      <p>Brood emits a complex blend that stimulates nurse bees to feed and cap larvae, biases foragers toward pollen collection when brood demand is high, and can accelerate worker behavioral maturation. Colonies with abundant open brood typically smell “brood-rich,” shifting resource allocation toward protein intake.</p>

      <h3 id="nasonov">Nasonov pheromone</h3>
      <p>Worker Nasonov glands (at the tip of the abdomen) release a lemony scent used for <em>orientation</em>—to rally swarms, mark hive entrances, and recruit nestmates to new cavities. Bees expose the gland and fan their wings to spread the plume. Beekeepers often see this during hive moves, after inspections, or when a cluster reforms.</p>

      <h3 id="alarm">Alarm pheromones</h3>
      <p>When a bee stings, alarm compounds (notably isopentyl acetate) mark the target and arouse nearby guards. This scent strongly increases defensive behavior. Minimizing alarm transfer—by avoiding crushing bees, using smooth movements, and applying cool, sparse smoke—reduces escalation.</p>

      <h3 id="footprint-trail">Footprint and trail-like cues</h3>
      <p>Workers leave cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) “footprints” as they walk. These contact cues are involved in nestmate recognition and may subtly guide traffic patterns on comb. While bees are not classical trail-laying insects like some ants, localized chemical cues help organize dense activity without collisions.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="recognition">
      <h2>Nestmate recognition and colony odor</h2>
      <p>Each colony maintains a composite odor signature formed by queen pheromones, CHCs, stored food, and microbial flora. Guard bees at the entrance evaluate incoming bees largely by smell. Familiar scents are admitted; unfamiliar blends trigger antennation and, if needed, rejection. This system reduces robbing and drifting. However, heavy nectar flows, crowded apiaries, or strong perfume and smoke can blur odor differences and increase drifting rates.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Drifting reduction:</strong> Stagger hive fronts, vary box colors or symbols, and avoid placing entrances in a perfect line. Distinctive “front-door smells” also help returning bees select the correct colony.</li>
        <li><strong>Comb transfer:</strong> When moving frames between colonies, be aware that foreign odors can provoke balling of queens or fighting. Gentle mixing via newspaper combines or gradual scent blending lowers risk.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="foraging">
      <h2>Flower odors and foraging efficiency</h2>
      <p>Flowers advertise using volatile blends that can be detected downwind. Bees learn which bouquets predict high nectar or pollen, and can ignore distractors after negative experiences. A single plant species may change its scent across the day or with pollination status. Bees track these changes; a forager may abandon a patch when odors no longer signal reward.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Odor–color combos:</strong> Scent often works with color and shape. If one channel is unreliable (e.g., low light), odor becomes decisive.</li>
        <li><strong>Scent marks:</strong> Foragers sometimes deposit temporary chemicals indicating “just visited” flowers, discouraging immediate revisits by nestmates and improving colony-level efficiency.</li>
        <li><strong>Recruitment:</strong> In the hive, the waggle dance advertises direction and approximate distance; floral scent carried by the dancer helps recruits lock onto the right patch on arrival.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="health">
      <h2>Health, hygiene, and olfaction</h2>
      <p>Hygienic workers use smell to detect diseased or dead brood behind capped cells. Subtle changes in volatile profiles—caused by brood death, fungal infections, or mite damage—trigger uncapping and removal. Selection for hygienic behavior leverages this sensory ability to reduce pathogen loads. Odor is also central to diagnosing queen issues: a sudden reduction in “queen-right” scent leads to louder hive tone, scattered behavior, and emergency cell construction.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mite-related cues:</strong> Varroa-infested brood emits different volatiles; some stocks detect and remove them more effectively.</li>
        <li><strong>Mold and moisture:</strong> Musty odors often reflect poor ventilation. Improving airflow and reducing condensation supports colony health (see also <a href="/wiki/colony-health/ventilation-and-mold.html">Hive Ventilation and Mold Control</a>, planned).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="practical">
      <h2>Practical guidance for beekeepers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Work with the wind:</strong> Stand to the side or downwind of the entrance so alarm scent and your own odor are not blown into the hive.</li>
        <li><strong>Use smoke sparingly and early:</strong> Cool, lightly applied smoke masks alarm odor and encourages bees to ingest honey, which reduces defensiveness. Over-smoking can saturate the hive with foreign odors and disrupt normal behavior.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep gear neutral:</strong> Avoid strong perfumes or solvents on gloves and suits; these can excite guards. Wash propolis and sting residues from tools between colonies.</li>
        <li><strong>Mark entrances and facades:</strong> Visual cues help, but so does scent continuity. Avoid swapping entrance reducers or mats among hives during robbing season.</li>
        <li><strong>Introduce queens thoughtfully:</strong> Slow introductions allow colony odors to blend and reduce rejections. Candy-release cages and small nuc acclimation help workers accept new queen scent.</li>
        <li><strong>Control robbing:</strong> If you smell a sharp “alarm/bananas” scent and see chaotic flight, reduce entrances and stop exposing honey or syrup. Prevent robbing before it starts by tidy feeding and quick manipulation.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="myths">
      <h2>Common myths and clarifications</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>“Bees follow trails like ants.”</strong> Honey bees do not lay long-range trail pheromones to food. Long-distance guidance comes from the waggle dance and celestial cues; odor identifies the goal at close range.</li>
        <li><strong>“All strong smells attract bees.”</strong> Attraction depends on learned association and the chemical match to floral blends. Many strong human-perceived scents are irrelevant or aversive to bees.</li>
        <li><strong>“More smoke is always better.”</strong> Excess smoke can cause confusion and stress. Aim for minimal puffs at the entrance and under the cover, waiting a minute before opening.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="observe">
      <h2>How to observe bee olfaction in the apiary</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Scent-labeled feeder test:</strong> Offer a scented feeder (e.g., anise) at a fixed site. After training, switch to an unscented feeder at the same site and note the decline—evidence that scent helps confirmation.</li>
        <li><strong>Entrance behavior:</strong> Watch guards antennate incoming bees on dearth days; you’ll see more inspections when colony odors are less distinct.</li>
        <li><strong>Queenless smell:</strong> Carefully compare the “feel” and odor of a queenright hive to a queenless one—workers’ agitation, fanning, and searching are apparent within hours of pheromone loss.</li>
      </ol>
