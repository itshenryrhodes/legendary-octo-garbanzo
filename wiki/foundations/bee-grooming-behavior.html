    <section id="why-it-matters">
      <h2>Why grooming matters</h2>
      <p>Grooming is a frontline defense for honey bees. At the individual level, it keeps sensory organs clear, protects wing joints and spiracles, and removes parasites. At the colony level, it reduces pathogen load, spreads antimicrobial substances such as propolis and glandular secretions, and can dislodge or damage <em>Varroa destructor</em> mites. Grooming sits alongside thermoregulation, hygienic brood removal, and nest sanitation as part of the social immune system of the hive.</p>

    <section id="types">
      <h2>Types of grooming</h2>

      <h3 id="autogrooming">Autogrooming (self-grooming)</h3>
      <p>Workers routinely comb their bodies with forelegs and midlegs, scraping debris toward the mouthparts. Key motions include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Antenna cleaning:</strong> Forelegs draw antennae through the <em>antennal cleaner</em>—a notch-and-spine structure on the foreleg that strips particles and wax.</li>
        <li><strong>Head and eye brushing:</strong> Short, rapid strokes clear the compound eyes and ocelli of dust and pollen.</li>
        <li><strong>Thorax and wing base grooming:</strong> Legs reach over the mesosoma to clear the wing hinges and spiracles where debris can accumulate.</li>
        <li><strong>Abdominal grooming:</strong> Bees arch and rake the abdomen to remove wax crumbs and spores that could interfere with respiration or cuticle function.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="allogrooming">Allogrooming (mutual grooming)</h3>
      <p>Workers groom nestmates, especially on inaccessible areas such as the dorsal thorax and wing bases. The receiver adopts a characteristic crouched posture with wings held slightly out. The groomer uses mandibles and forelegs to pick off particles and, occasionally, bite at mites.</p>

      <h3 id="defensive-grooming">Defensive grooming against mites</h3>
      <p>When stimulated by movement on the cuticle, workers perform vigorous rubbing and rapid abdomen flexing. If a mite is contacted, the bee may roll, bite, or scrape it free. Nestmates sometimes join, leading to brief “grooming balls” where several workers attend the affected bee.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="triggers">
      <h2>What triggers grooming?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tactile cues:</strong> Something moving on the cuticle (mite, small ant, debris) evokes rapid autogrooming.</li>
        <li><strong>Chemical cues:</strong> Odors of diseased brood or cuticular changes can increase allogrooming and inspection.</li>
        <li><strong>Environmental conditions:</strong> Dusty flows, heavy propolizing periods, or smoky air (wildfires, poor ventilation) often increase baseline grooming.</li>
        <li><strong>Social context:</strong> High-density colonies and crowded entrances produce more bee-to-bee contact and mutual grooming opportunities.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="hygienic-vs-grooming">
      <h2>Hygienic behavior vs. grooming—what’s the difference?</h2>
      <p><strong>Grooming</strong> targets adults and removes surface contaminants or phoretic mites. <strong>Hygienic behavior</strong> targets brood: workers detect, uncap, and remove infected or parasitized pupae. The two are related but distinct. Some stocks are selected for <a href="/wiki/colony-health/hygienic-breeding.html">hygienic traits</a> (planned), others for enhanced grooming or <em>Varroa</em>-sensitive hygiene (VSH). In practice, colonies showing strong hygienic scores often also exhibit frequent mutual grooming bouts and higher mite drop after disturbance—useful signals during inspections.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="what-to-look-for">
      <h2>What beekeepers can observe</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Frequent mutual grooming at the top bars:</strong> Short, intense bouts with two or three workers clustered, often near areas with traffic or dust.</li>
        <li><strong>Mite damage signs:</strong> Fallen mites on bottom boards with <em>chew marks</em> (missing legs or damaged carapace) suggest active defensive grooming.</li>
        <li><strong>Clean antennae and eyes:</strong> Workers in groomed colonies show less visible dusting even during heavy pollen flows.</li>
        <li><strong>Lower phoretic mite load after disturbances:</strong> For example, a gentle shake of a frame over a white tray followed by increased mite drop over the next hour can indicate effective grooming responses.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Combine entrance observations with formal sampling. See your published reference: <a href="/wiki/colony-health/varroa-monitoring-schedule.html">Varroa monitoring schedule</a>.</p>

    <section id="measurement">
      <h2>Measuring grooming in the field</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Sticky board assay:</strong> Install a sticky board under a screened bottom for 24–48 hours. Count total mites and classify a subset for visible damage (chewed or missing parts). A higher proportion damaged can indicate stronger grooming pressure.</li>
        <li><strong>Timed grooming challenge:</strong> Lightly dust a small cohort of workers (e.g., powdered sugar in a cup cage, then release onto top bars) and time to “clean” appearance. Faster cleaning correlates with active autogrooming; avoid overuse or use only as part of research protocols.</li>
        <li><strong>Video sampling:</strong> Record 10-minute clips at the top bars and brood nest. Tally mutual grooming bouts per minute per 100 bees. Repeat across days to smooth variation.</li>
        <li><strong>Mite drop after disturbance:</strong> Briefly disturb frames (gentle shake) then track mite fall at 30–60 minute intervals.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Field measurements are noisy. Replicate across days and compare within your apiary to rank colonies rather than rely on absolute thresholds.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="links-varroa">
      <h2>Grooming and <em>Varroa</em> management</h2>
      <p>Grooming alone rarely keeps mites below treatment thresholds, but it can slow growth and improve resilience when paired with integrated pest management (IPM). Colonies with noticeable grooming typically show:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Higher proportion of damaged mites on sticky boards.</li>
        <li>More “mite-bite” mandible wear in older workers (a research observation).</li>
        <li>Lower phoretic loads between treatments, all else equal.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Fold grooming observations into your IPM plan alongside alcohol washes, drone brood trapping, brood breaks, and approved treatments. For broader context see planned pages <a href="/wiki/colony-health/varroa-life-cycle.html">Varroa Mite Life Cycle</a> and <a href="/wiki/colony-health/varroa-treatment-honeybeehealth.html">Varroa Treatment</a>, plus your published <a href="/wiki/colony-health/hygienic-behaviour-testing.html">Hygienic behaviour testing</a>.</p>

    <section id="supporting">
      <h2>How to support grooming in practice</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Maintain appropriate space:</strong> Avoid chronic congestion. Overcrowded hives show more agitation and less efficient self-maintenance.</li>
        <li><strong>Ventilation and humidity control:</strong> Damp conditions encourage mold and sticky surfaces that impede grooming. See <a href="/wiki/colony-health/ventilation-and-mold.html">Hive Ventilation and Mold Control</a> (planned).</li>
        <li><strong>Comb management:</strong> Replace dark, broken, or heavily propolized comb on a regular cycle so bees spend less time fighting sticky surfaces and more on productive tasks. See <a href="/wiki/operations/comb-replacement.html">Replacing Old Comb</a> (planned).</li>
        <li><strong>Propolis-friendly interiors:</strong> Leaving some rough wood surfaces or propolis mats gives bees antimicrobial materials they spread during grooming.</li>
        <li><strong>Disturb gently:</strong> Calm inspections (<a href="/wiki/operations/first-inspection-checklist.html">First inspection checklist</a>, published) reduce panic behaviors that can suppress normal grooming patterns.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutrition:</strong> Adequate protein and micronutrients support cuticle integrity and gland function. See planned <a href="/wiki/foundations/bee-diet-nutrition.html">Honey Bee Nutrition</a>.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="breeding">
      <h2>Breeding and stock selection</h2>
      <p>Some lines exhibit stronger grooming and mite-biting traits. When evaluating queens or survivor stock:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ask for data:</strong> Hygienic scores, mite growth curves, and notes on damaged-mite proportions over a season.</li>
        <li><strong>Observe daughters:</strong> Traits can vary with drones and local conditions; re-evaluate each generation.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid single-trait selection:</strong> Balance grooming with temperament, spring buildup, and honey production.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>See planned reference pages <a href="/wiki/colony-health/hygienic-breeding.html">Breeding for Hygienic Behavior</a> and <a href="/wiki/colony-health/resistant-breeds.html">Varroa-Resistant Bee Breeds</a>.</p>

    <section id="myths">
      <h2>Common pitfalls and myths</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>“Grooming eliminates the need for monitoring.”</strong> It does not. Keep up your <a href="/wiki/colony-health/varroa-monitoring-schedule.html">monitoring schedule</a> (published).</li>
        <li><strong>“Any white dusting means grooming is happening.”</strong> Dust can also signal comb wear, robbing, or wax moth frass. Validate with direct observation.</li>
        <li><strong>“More propolis always means cleaner bees.”</strong> Propolis is antimicrobial, but excessive propolis on moving parts can hinder wing and leg movements and complicate grooming.</li>
        <li><strong>“A single chewed mite proves control.”</strong> Chewed mites are one indicator; track counts over time and compare among colonies.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="seasonality">
      <h2>Seasonality and context</h2>
      <p>Grooming frequency shifts with colony demographics and environment. Young workers groom more as they transition from nursing to guarding and foraging. You may see spikes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Early spring:</strong> As brood rearing surges, bees clean pollen residues more frequently.</li>
        <li><strong>Mid-flow:</strong> Heavy traffic increases contact and mutual grooming at top bars and entrances.</li>
        <li><strong>Late season:</strong> Dust and propolis accumulation and drifting can raise grooming around the landing board.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="workflow">
      <h2>Workflow: integrating grooming into your health checks</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Observe before opening:</strong> Note any grooming clusters at the entrance and landing board behavior.</li>
        <li><strong>Top-bar sampling:</strong> After removing the cover, scan for brief mutual grooming bouts and note frequency.</li>
        <li><strong>Sticky board snapshot:</strong> Deploy a board for 24 hours monthly during the active season; classify a subset of fallen mites.</li>
        <li><strong>Log context:</strong> Weather, nectar flow, and management events (supering, feeding) for interpretation.</li>
        <li><strong>Act on trends:</strong> If grooming signals weaken while mite loads rise, escalate IPM steps.</li>
      </ol>
