    <section id="overview">
      <h2>What is Deformed Wing Virus?</h2>
      <p>Deformed Wing Virus (DWV) is a group of closely related viruses in honey bees that can cause visibly deformed wings, shortened abdomens, and reduced lifespan in adult workers. DWV is common and often present at low levels in otherwise healthy colonies. The dramatic symptoms beekeepers associate with DWV—crawling, non-flying adults with crumpled wings—typically emerge when virus replication surges after infestation with the parasitic mite <em>Varroa destructor</em>. Because <em>Varroa</em> efficiently transmits and amplifies DWV, visible cases are better viewed as a mite-pressure signal than a standalone disease event.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="signs">
      <h2>Key signs and field recognition</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Adult symptoms:</strong> Wings reduced or crumpled; shortened, sometimes bloated abdomens; trembling or crawling bees unable to fly. Affected adults usually die within days.</li>
        <li><strong>Brood pattern:</strong> Patchy brood and increased hygienic removal when virus pressure is high, though brood disease signs are not specific to DWV.</li>
        <li><strong>Population effects:</strong> Reduced forager numbers (flightless emergents), waning colony strength, poor supersedure outcomes, and winter losses following late-season mite spikes.</li>
        <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Visible cases often rise late summer through autumn in temperate climates, paralleling mite population growth and virus titers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Importantly, not every deformed wing indicates DWV; chilling injury or other developmental stressors can also cause wing deformities. See <a href="/wiki/colony-health/deformed-wing-causes.html">Causes of Deformed Wings</a> for differential considerations.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="biology">
      <h2>Biology and variants</h2>
      <p>DWV comprises multiple variants (commonly discussed as A, B, and C). Differences among variants can influence virulence and colony outcomes, but from an operational standpoint the management levers remain the same: reduce mite vectors, protect developing brood, and maintain strong nutrition and queen quality.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="transmission">
      <h2>Transmission pathways</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><em>Varroa</em>-mediated</strong> (primary): Mites puncture developing pupae and feed on fat body tissue, directly injecting virus and enabling explosive replication. This route produces the most severe outcomes and is the main driver of symptomatic DWV.</li>
        <li><strong>Vertical</strong> (queen → eggs) and <strong>horizontal</strong> (trophallaxis, fecal/oral): These routes circulate virus at low levels within many colonies; symptoms are uncommon without mite amplification.</li>
        <li><strong>Drifting and robbing:</strong> Adult movement between colonies can transport both mites and virus, creating yard-level synchrony in outbreaks.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="risk">
      <h2>Risk factors and why outbreaks escalate</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Late-season mite spikes:</strong> Colonies that enter autumn with elevated <em>Varroa</em> loads are at greatest risk of symptomatic DWV and winter loss.</li>
        <li><strong>Queen failure or brood gaps:</strong> Stress that disrupts brood care (or creates a sudden cohort of vulnerable pupae) can intensify impacts.</li>
        <li><strong>Poor nutrition:</strong> Pollen dearth and low protein diets reduce immune competence and shorten adult lifespan, compounding virus damage.</li>
        <li><strong>High colony density and drifting:</strong> Tight yard layouts accelerate reinfestation even after treatment (“mite bombs”).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="monitoring">
      <h2>Monitoring and indicators</h2>
      <p>Because visual symptoms appear late, routine mite monitoring is the best early-warning system for DWV risk.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mite counts:</strong> Use alcohol wash or sugar roll on a standard sample size to estimate infestation rate. See <a href="/wiki/colony-health/varroa-monitoring-schedule.html">Varroa Monitoring Schedule</a> for thresholds and cadence.</li>
        <li><strong>Brood inspections:</strong> Watch for patchy brood, increased pupal removal, and emerging adults with wing deformities near the brood nest.</li>
        <li><strong>Population metrics:</strong> Track colony weight, forager traffic, and age distribution. Sudden drops in flight activity during good weather can signal high emergence of non-flying adults.</li>
        <li><strong>Diagnostics (optional):</strong> Lab or kit-based virus quantification can measure DWV load, but management decisions usually hinge on <em>Varroa</em> levels and visible outcomes rather than titers. See <a href="/wiki/colony-health/colony-diagnostics-tests.html">Colony Diagnostic Tests</a>.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="ipm">
      <h2>Management: IPM first, not virology</h2>
      <p>DWV management is essentially <em>Varroa</em> management. Use an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach that blends cultural, mechanical, and chemical controls as needed, timed to protect brood and avoid residues.</p>

      <h3>Foundational practices</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Seasonal plan:</strong> Commit to a season-long plan that prevents late-summer mite run-ups. Calendar discipline beats emergency treatments.</li>
        <li><strong>Genetic and queen quality:</strong> Purchase queens from lines selected for hygienic behavior (<a href="/wiki/colony-health/hygienic-breeding.html">hygienic breeding</a>) and consider periodic requeening to maintain brood viability and temperament.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutrition:</strong> Provide abundant, diverse forage; supplement only when needed. See <a href="/wiki/operations/feeding-pollen-supplements.html">Feeding Pollen Supplements</a> and <a href="/wiki/operations/feeding-sugar-syrup.html">Feeding Sugar Syrup</a> for safe practices.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Mechanical and cultural tools</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Drone brood removal:</strong> Provide drone foundation frames early, then freeze or cut capped drone brood on a 21-day cycle to cull mites. See <a href="/wiki/colony-health/drone-brood-removal.html">Drone Brood Removal as Mite Control</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Screened bottoms:</strong> Screened bottom boards may marginally reduce mite loads and assist with monitoring. See <a href="/wiki/colony-health/scraping-mites.html">Screen Floors and Mite Reduction</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Brood breaks:</strong> Controlled brood interruptions (e.g., caging queens or splits) can synchronize treatments and reduce mite reproduction windows.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Miticides and timing</h3>
      <p>Chemical treatments reduce vector pressure when infestation exceeds threshold or as part of a planned rotation. Choice depends on temperature, brood presence, and honey flow status. See <a href="/wiki/colony-health/varroa-treatment-honeybeehealth.html">Varroa Treatment</a> for a comparative overview and rotation strategies.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Formic acid:</strong> Penetrates capped brood; temperature-sensitive; avoid during extreme heat or with weak colonies.</li>
        <li><strong>Oxalic acid:</strong> Highly effective on phoretic mites; best during broodless windows (late fall, post-split, or after induced brood break).</li>
        <li><strong>Thymol-based:</strong> Useful in warm weather; can affect queen/bee behavior if overdosed; follow label precisely.</li>
        <li><strong>Synthetics (where legal):</strong> Rotate actives to limit resistance; respect withdrawal and residue guidelines.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>After-treatment checks</h3>
      <p>Always re-monitor to confirm efficacy. If counts remain high, reassess dosage, timing, brood status, and reinfestation pressure from neighboring colonies.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="outbreak">
      <h2>Responding to visible DWV cases</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Quantify mites today.</strong> Perform an alcohol wash or sugar roll. If above threshold, treat promptly per label and conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Protect upcoming cohorts.</strong> Aim to reduce mites before the next wave of pupae is capped; consider a brood break to enhance oxalic efficacy.</li>
        <li><strong>Support nutrition.</strong> Ensure protein and carbohydrate availability to maximize survival of healthy emergents.</li>
        <li><strong>Cull failing queens judiciously.</strong> If brood viability remains poor after mite control and nutrition, evaluate queen replacement (see <a href="/wiki/colony-health/queenhealth-and-replacement.html">Queen Health and Replacement</a>).</li>
        <li><strong>Reduce reinfestation.</strong> Tighten apiary layout to limit drifting; coordinate control with nearby beekeepers when possible.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="prevention">
      <h2>Prevention through season planning</h2>
      <p>The most reliable way to avoid symptomatic DWV is to prevent late-season mite surges. A practical annual rhythm:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Baseline mite counts after buildup begins; employ cultural controls early (drone brood trapping).</li>
        <li><strong>Early summer:</strong> Confirm counts remain below threshold as honey flow peaks; avoid disruptive treatments during heavy nectar unless label permits.</li>
        <li><strong>Late summer:</strong> Intervene decisively if counts rise—this is the critical window to protect the winter bee cohort.</li>
        <li><strong>Autumn:</strong> Create a broodless period where practical and apply oxalic acid; verify counts drop.</li>
        <li><strong>Winter:</strong> Spot-check; plan spring readiness and equipment maintenance.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="myths">
      <h2>Common myths and clarifications</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>“DWV is the root problem.”</strong> <em>Varroa</em> is the driver of symptomatic DWV in most cases. Treat the vector, not only the symptom.</li>
        <li><strong>“If I don’t see deformed wings, I’m fine.”</strong> Dangerous viral loads often build before visible cases appear; routine monitoring is non-negotiable.</li>
        <li><strong>“One treatment fixes it.”</strong> Temporary drops in mite counts won’t prevent rebound without an integrated, seasonal strategy.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="records">
      <h2>Records and evidence</h2>
      <p>Link your field notes and sensor data so you can learn from outcomes. Track infestation rates, treatments (dose, date, temperature), queen status, and nutrition changes. See <a href="/wiki/operations/record-keeping.html">Record-Keeping for Hives</a> and <a href="/wiki/data-sensing/data-management-practices.html">Data Management for Beekeepers</a> to create repeatable workflows.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="decision">
      <h2>Quick decision guide</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>See multiple adults with deformed wings:</strong> Sample mites immediately; if above threshold, treat now following label and weather constraints.</li>
        <li><strong>Late summer, counts borderline:</strong> Pair mechanical control (drone brood removal, brood break) with a suitable miticide to protect winter bees.</li>
        <li><strong>Post-treatment:</strong> Re-sample within 10–14 days; if counts remain high, check for reinfestation sources and adjust method.</li>
      </ul>
