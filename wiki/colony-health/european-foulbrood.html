      <h2>What is EFB?</h2>
      <p>
        European foulbrood (EFB) is a bacterial disease of <strong>unsealed (open) brood</strong> caused chiefly by
        <em>Melissococcus plutonius</em>. Unlike American foulbrood (AFB), EFB typically <strong>does not involve spore formation</strong>
        and often surges during the spring buildup when colonies expand faster than incoming nutrition. It can appear, worsen, and then
        regress within the same season if the underlying stresses are resolved.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Agent:</strong> <em>Melissococcus plutonius</em> (with occasional secondary bacteria that complicate the picture).</li>
        <li><strong>Primary target:</strong> Larvae in <em>open</em> cells (pre-capping).</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonality:</strong> Commonest in spring/early summer; often linked to forage dearth, crowding, or chilling.</li>
        <li><strong>Transmission:</strong> Nurse bees spread contaminated food; movement of infected frames can seed new cases.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="field-signs">
      <h2>Field signs &amp; how it differs from AFB</h2>
      <p>EFB has a characteristic set of visual clues. Focus on <strong>open brood</strong> behavior and overall brood pattern.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Patchy brood pattern:</strong> Many empty cells where larvae died before capping; looks “peppered.”</li>
        <li><strong>Larval position:</strong> Sick larvae lie <strong>twisted or coiled</strong> off-center rather than neatly curled.</li>
        <li><strong>Color &amp; consistency:</strong> Pearly-white turns <strong>yellowish</strong>, then tan; larvae become <strong>flaccid</strong> and granular rather than ropey.</li>
        <li><strong>Odor:</strong> Sometimes a <strong>sour</strong> smell; not always present.</li>
        <li><strong>Cappings:</strong> Because death is pre-capping, you may see <strong>fewer perforated cappings</strong> than with AFB.</li>
        <li><strong>“Rope test”:</strong> Usually <strong>negative</strong> (AFB is typically ropey). EFB larval remains do not draw out in long threads.</li>
        <li><strong>Scales:</strong> If larvae dry, they may leave <strong>rubbery or brittle scales</strong> loosely adhering to the cell wall (easier to remove than AFB scales).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In contrast, AFB primarily affects <em>capped</em> brood, produces sunken/perforated cappings, a positive rope test, and forms tough,
        adherent scales. If you’re unsure, proceed to testing.
      </p>

    <section id="differentials">
      <h2>Common look-alikes (differentials)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Chilled brood:</strong> Occurs after cold snaps or strong splits; larvae turn greyish, but odor is minimal and colonies recover as temperatures stabilize.</li>
        <li><strong>Sacbrood virus (SBV):</strong> Larvae form a <em>sac</em> with watery contents; head often upturned; dried “gondola” scale; no sour odor.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutritional stress:</strong> Starved larvae may discolor; pattern improves rapidly after nectar/pollen flow returns.</li>
        <li><strong>AFB:</strong> See notes above; use testing if uncertain.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="confirmation">
      <h2>Confirming EFB: quick and lab tests</h2>
      <p>Confirm before major interventions—especially where reporting rules apply.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lateral flow (rapid) kits:</strong> On-site immunoassays for <em>M. plutonius</em>. Useful for triage.</li>
        <li><strong>Microscopy &amp; culture/PCR:</strong> Veterinary or apiary labs can confirm species and strain; PCR is sensitive.</li>
        <li><strong>Sampling tips:</strong> Select freshly sick, <em>uncapped</em> larvae. Avoid dried scales when possible.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note"><strong>Legal note:</strong> Reporting and permitted treatments vary by jurisdiction. Check local requirements before applying antibiotics or moving equipment.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="risk-factors">
      <h2>Risk factors &amp; triggers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Nutritional gaps:</strong> poor nectar or pollen flow; monocultures with limited protein profile.</li>
        <li><strong>Colony stress:</strong> queen issues, overcrowding, transport, weather swings (chill then warm).</li>
        <li><strong>Hygiene lapses:</strong> sharing contaminated frames, tools, or feeders between colonies.</li>
        <li><strong>High larval density:</strong> booming spring colonies can outpace nurse bee capacity to feed hygienically.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="ipm">
      <h2>Management (IPM-first)</h2>
      <p>EFB frequently improves when stress is lifted. Start with non-chemical steps; add therapeutics only if allowed and necessary.</p>

      <h3>Immediate containment</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Isolate the yard:</strong> Mark affected hives; <strong>do not</strong> share frames or tools until cleaned.</li>
        <li><strong>Disinfect tools:</strong> Scrape propolis/wax; flame or use an effective disinfectant compatible with your equipment.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduce robbing:</strong> Narrow entrances; avoid exposing infected larval remains.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Nutritional &amp; husbandry corrections</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Feed appropriately:</strong> Provide light syrup when nectar is short and a high-quality pollen supplement if natural pollen is scarce (avoid overfeeding that crowds brood).</li>
        <li><strong>Space management:</strong> Add comb to prevent congestion; remove dark, damaged comb over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Requeen if needed:</strong> A young, vigorous queen improves brood pattern and nurse population stability.</li>
        <li><strong>Brood break:</strong> A managed brood break (e.g., caging the queen briefly) can help nurses “catch up.”</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Shook swarm / comb replacement</h3>
      <p>
        In more serious cases, a <strong>shook swarm</strong> (shaking all bees onto clean foundation and removing infected brood comb) can
        rapidly reduce bacterial load. This is labor-intensive but avoids drug residues in honey. Ensure adequate nutrition afterward.
      </p>

      <h3>Therapeutics (jurisdiction dependent)</h3>
      <p>
        In some regions, antibiotics (e.g., oxytetracycline) may be permitted for EFB under label and veterinary oversight. Where allowed,
        follow dosage, timing (avoid honey flow), and withdrawal requirements strictly. Do not rely on routine prophylaxis; correct husbandry
        is the long-term solution.
      </p>

      <h3>When to cull comb or equipment</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Heavily affected frames:</strong> Remove and render wax; scorch wooden ware where appropriate.</li>
        <li><strong>Extractables:</strong> Avoid extracting honey from obviously contaminated brood frames; store supers separately until disease is controlled.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="monitoring">
      <h2>Monitoring &amp; follow-up</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Inspection cadence:</strong> Re-inspect in 7–10 days; you should see fewer sick larvae and a tightening brood pattern.</li>
        <li><strong>Colony records:</strong> Note date, symptoms, interventions, and pictures. Trends matter more than single snapshots.</li>
        <li><strong>Yard-level view:</strong> Check neighbors in the same yard; shared forage and drift can synchronize outbreaks.</li>
      </ul>

    </section>

    <section id="prevention">
      <h2>Prevention for next season</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Comb renewal:</strong> Cycle out old, dark brood comb on a schedule to lower microbial loads.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutrition planning:</strong> Place apiaries where <em>both</em> nectar and diverse pollen are reliable; plant forage buffers where possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Hygienic stock:</strong> Favor queens with strong hygienic behavior; monitor using simple field tests. See <a href="/wiki/colony-health/hygienic-behaviour-testing.html">Hygienic behaviour testing</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Equipment discipline:</strong> Standardize cleaning between yards; dedicate gloves, hive tools, or alcohol wipes per yard.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid over-stimulation:</strong> Excessive feeding that bursts brood production without matching protein inflow can set the stage for EFB.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="qna">
      <h2>Quick Q&amp;A</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Is EFB always fatal?</dt>
        <dd>No. Mild cases often resolve with nutrition and reduced stress. Severe or recurrent cases need assertive action.</dd>

        <dt>Can I move infected colonies?</dt>
        <dd>Movement rules vary. Many regions restrict moving diseased colonies or require permits. Check local guidance first.</dd>

        <dt>Do I have to burn equipment?</dt>
        <dd>Unlike AFB, destruction is rarely mandated for EFB. However, removing heavily affected brood comb and thorough disinfection are recommended.</dd>
