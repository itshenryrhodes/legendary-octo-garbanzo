      <h2>Why diagnostics matter</h2>
      <p>Good decisions come from good measurements. Colonies can fail for very different reasons that look similar from outside the box. A repeatable diagnostic workflow—paired with clear record-keeping—lets you identify the primary stressor, choose the least disruptive response, and verify that your action worked. This page focuses on the <em>how</em> of testing: what to sample, the tools you need, and how to interpret results alongside signs seen on frames.</p>
      <p>Use this article with <a href="/wiki/colony-health/hive-health-assessment.html">Colony Health Assessment</a> for visual signs, with <a href="/wiki/colony-health/varroa-monitoring-schedule.html">Varroa Monitoring Schedule</a> for timing and thresholds, and with disease pages such as <a href="/wiki/colony-health/american-foulbrood.html">American Foulbrood</a>, <a href="/wiki/colony-health/european-foulbrood.html">European Foulbrood</a>, <a href="/wiki/colony-health/nosema-disease.html">Nosema</a>, and <a href="/wiki/colony-health/deformed-wing-virus.html">Deformed Wing Virus</a>.</p>

    <section id="sampling-plan">
      <h2>Designing a sampling plan</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Objective first:</strong> Are you screening routine health (spring/fall), investigating specific symptoms, or verifying treatment efficacy? Your goal determines which tests to run.</li>
        <li><strong>Representative bees:</strong> For parasite/pathogen screening, sample adult <em>nurse bees</em> from brood frames (not foragers at the entrance). Nurses carry higher pathogen and mite loads.</li>
        <li><strong>Replicates:</strong> In yards with many hives, test a subset but include any colony that looks atypical (spotty brood, unusual odor, crawling bees, deformed wings).</li>
        <li><strong>Label and log:</strong> Assign a sample ID, date, colony ID, yard, weather, and notes. Use a consistent sheet or app (<a href="/wiki/data-sensing/smartphone-apps-beekeeping.html">apps for beekeepers</a>, <a href="/wiki/data-sensing/bee-farm-management-software.html">apiary management software</a>).</li>
        <li><strong>Biosecurity:</strong> Use clean gloves and tools between hives, flame your hive tool if investigating foulbrood, and double-bag suspect samples.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="varroa-tests">
      <h2>Varroa mite testing</h2>
      <p>Because <em>Varroa destructor</em> drives much of modern colony loss, mite testing is the most valuable routine diagnostic. Choose one primary method and repeat it consistently each time so results are comparable.</p>

      <h3 id="alcohol-wash">Alcohol wash (gold standard)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>What it measures:</strong> Estimated mite load per 100 bees by dislodging mites.</li>
        <li><strong>Materials:</strong> Jar with mesh lid, 70% isopropyl alcohol (or ethanol), measuring scoop, white tray.</li>
        <li><strong>Sample:</strong> ~1/2 cup (≈300) nurse bees shaken from an open-brood frame into a container; avoid the queen.</li>
        <li><strong>Procedure:</strong> Cover bees with alcohol, swirl 60 seconds, drain through mesh into tray, refill and repeat; count mites in tray. Count bees or compute by volume.</li>
        <li><strong>Result:</strong> Report as mites per 100 bees. Compare to your <a href="/wiki/colony-health/varroa-monitoring-schedule.html">seasonal thresholds</a>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="sugar-roll">Sugar roll (non-lethal)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>What it measures:</strong> Dislodged mites using powdered sugar.</li>
        <li><strong>Materials:</strong> Jar with mesh lid, confectioners’ sugar, white tray, water spray bottle.</li>
        <li><strong>Procedure:</strong> Add ~300 bees to jar, 2 tbsp sugar, roll for 60 seconds, rest 1 minute, shake mites onto tray; mist to dissolve sugar for easier counting.</li>
        <li><strong>Caveats:</strong> Accuracy depends on humidity and technique; still useful when alcohol wash is impractical.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="sticky-board">Sticky board (drop counts)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>What it measures:</strong> Natural or induced mite drop per day on a sticky board under a screened bottom.</li>
        <li><strong>Use case:</strong> Trending before/after treatments. Less reliable for absolute infestation compared to wash/roll.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="brood-uncapping">Drone brood uncapping</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>What it shows:</strong> Infestation inside capped drone cells. Helps time <a href="/wiki/colony-health/drone-brood-removal.html">drone brood removal</a> tactics; not a substitute for adult-bee sampling.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="brood-diseases">
      <h2>Diagnosing brood diseases</h2>
      <p>Abnormal brood patterns can arise from nutrition, temperature, queen age, and pathogens. Start with inspection cues, then confirm with rapid tests or lab submission as needed.</p>

      <h3 id="afb">American foulbrood (AFB)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Field signs:</strong> Sunken perforated cappings, coffee-brown larval remains, characteristic odor in advanced cases, “rope” test from cell contents.</li>
        <li><strong>Rapid test kits:</strong> Commercial lateral-flow immunoassays can detect AFB antigens from a swab of suspicious cells.</li>
        <li><strong>Confirmatory:</strong> Lab culture or PCR where available. Handle suspect frames carefully; avoid spreading spores between hives.</li>
        <li><strong>Next steps:</strong> Follow your jurisdiction’s guidance; see <a href="/wiki/colony-health/american-foulbrood.html">AFB</a> and <a href="/wiki/community-policy/apiary-inspections.html">Apiary Inspections</a>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="efb">European foulbrood (EFB)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Field signs:</strong> Uncapped or poorly capped larvae that appear twisted or melted, color from white to yellowish; no ropey consistency.</li>
        <li><strong>Rapid test kits:</strong> Lateral-flow kits exist for EFB as well.</li>
        <li><strong>Context:</strong> Often associated with nutritional stress; improving forage and requeening can help. See <a href="/wiki/colony-health/european-foulbrood.html">EFB</a>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="chalkbrood">Chalkbrood</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Field signs:</strong> Hard, chalky mummies (white to black) in cells or on the bottom board.</li>
        <li><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> Usually clinical based on mummies; lab microscopy can confirm.</li>
        <li><strong>Next steps:</strong> Reduce stress, improve ventilation, replace old combs; see <a href="/wiki/colony-health/chalkbrood-disease.html">Chalkbrood Disease</a>.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="nosema">
      <h2>Nosema testing (microscopy)</h2>
      <p><em>Nosema apis</em> and <em>Nosema ceranae</em> infect adult bees’ midgut. A quick spore count guides whether management changes are warranted.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sample:</strong> 25–60 adult bees (preferably older workers from inside the hive). Freeze if not processing immediately.</li>
        <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Homogenize abdomens in a measured volume of water (e.g., 1 mL per bee) using a mortar or zip-bag and roller.</li>
        <li><strong>Microscopy:</strong> Place a drop on a slide; count spores using 400×. Report as spores per bee (convert from hemocytometer counts).</li>
        <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Look for trends across time and season rather than a single cutoff. Correlate with dysentery, reduced longevity, and poor build-up; see <a href="/wiki/colony-health/nosema-disease.html">Nosema Disease</a>.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="viruses">
      <h2>Virus screening</h2>
      <p>Common viruses (DWV, IAPV, CBPV, BQCV) are ubiquitous at low levels; high titers usually track with Varroa pressure.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>When to test:</strong> If colonies show neurologic signs (trembling, hairless shiny bees), deformed wings not explained by mite counts, or unexplained autumn dwindle.</li>
        <li><strong>How:</strong> Submit preserved adult samples to a bee lab for PCR/RT-qPCR quantification. Track results with concurrent mite data to understand cause, not just correlation.</li>
        <li><strong>Acting on results:</strong> Focus on reducing Varroa and improving nutrition; antiviral treatments are not standard practice. See <a href="/wiki/colony-health/deformed-wing-virus.html">DWV</a>.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="pesticides">
      <h2>Suspected pesticide exposure</h2>
      <p>Field clues include piles of fresh dead bees at the entrance, disoriented foragers, or brood unaffected initially. If you suspect exposure:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Collect 200–300 fresh dead bees in solvent-rinsed containers (no wax or propolis) and keep cool.</li>
        <li>Note crop bloom, recent sprays, wind, and water sources. Photograph labels if safe and appropriate.</li>
        <li>Contact your extension or testing lab for chain-of-custody and shipping instructions.</li>
        <li>Consult <a href="/wiki/community-policy/pesticide-spray-notification.html">Pesticide Application Notification</a> and <a href="/wiki/community-policy/pesticide-risk-management.html">Risk Management Plans</a>.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="thresholds">
      <h2>Interpreting results and acting</h2>
      <p>Numbers are only useful when tied to thresholds and a playbook. Examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mites per 100 bees:</strong> Compare to seasonal thresholds in your <a href="/wiki/colony-health/varroa-monitoring-schedule.html">monitoring schedule</a>. If over threshold, select a treatment compatible with weather, brood status, and honey supers; see <a href="/wiki/colony-health/varroa-treatment-honeybeehealth.html">treatment options</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>AFB/EFB positive:</strong> Follow regulatory guidance. For AFB, equipment handling is critical; for EFB, improve nutrition and consider a management/labeled medication plan where permitted.</li>
        <li><strong>High Nosema trend:</strong> Emphasize forage quality, reduce stress, and rotate older comb; medications are jurisdiction-specific and not always indicated.</li>
        <li><strong>Virus titers high with mites low:</strong> Re-verify mite counts (repeat alcohol wash). If still low, check for nutrition gaps and queen performance.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="workflow">
      <h2>A simple yard workflow</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Visual triage:</strong> On opening, score cluster size, brood pattern, food frames, moisture, and odors. Note wing deformities or trembling bees.</li>
        <li><strong>Mite test:</strong> Perform an alcohol wash or sugar roll on a brood-frame sample.</li>
        <li><strong>Brood spot checks:</strong> If brood is patchy or discolored, collect targeted photos and, if warranted, use a rapid foulbrood test.</li>
        <li><strong>Nosema sample (optional):</strong> If spring build-up is poor or dysentery present, collect bees for microscopy.</li>
        <li><strong>Record decisions:</strong> Log test values and the action (treat, feed, requeen, recheck). Schedule a follow-up test 7–14 days after interventions where appropriate.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="mistakes">
      <h2>Common mistakes to avoid</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sampling the wrong bees:</strong> Entrance foragers understate parasite loads; always target nurses on open brood.</li>
        <li><strong>Inconsistent methods:</strong> Switching between sugar roll and alcohol wash makes trend lines noisy. Pick one and stick to it.</li>
        <li><strong>Too few bees:</strong> Small samples inflate error. Aim for ~300 adults for mite testing.</li>
        <li><strong>Counting bias:</strong> Use a white tray and good light; recount if uncertain.</li>
        <li><strong>No baseline:</strong> Without pre-treatment data, you can’t verify efficacy. Test before and after.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-contamination:</strong> Reuse of gloves/tools on suspect foulbrood frames spreads spores; flame or replace tools.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="kit">
      <h2>Recommended diagnostic kit</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Alcohol wash jar with mesh lid (or sugar roll jar) and measuring scoop.</li>
        <li>Powdered sugar and clean isopropyl alcohol (70%).</li>
        <li>White catch tray or pan; squeeze bottle for water (sugar roll).</li>
        <li>Rapid test kits for AFB/EFB (kept sealed, check expiry).</li>
        <li>Sample vials, labels, and permanent marker.</li>
        <li>Thick nitrile gloves and lighter/torch for tool sanitation when needed.</li>
        <li>Optional: Portable microscope/hemocytometer for Nosema counts.</li>
      </ul>
