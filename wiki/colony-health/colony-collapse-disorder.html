      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p><strong>Colony Collapse Disorder</strong> (CCD) is a specific syndrome of honey bee colony failure first widely reported in the mid-2000s. Its hallmark pattern is a rapid loss of the adult worker population with the queen, brood, and ample food stores left behind—and few or no dead bees in or around the hive. While overall colony losses may be caused by many factors, only a fraction match the strict CCD pattern.</p>
      <p>Most recent losses in many regions are now better explained by <a href="/wiki/colony-health/varroa-life-cycle.html">Varroa destructor</a> and associated viruses, nutritional stress, queen problems, and weather extremes rather than classical CCD. Even so, understanding CCD clarifies what to watch for, what to rule out, and which management steps consistently reduce risk.</p>

    <section id="history">
      <h2>How CCD was described</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Initial reports: commercial operators documented sudden spring or fall collapses with brood and food present but adult workers missing.</li>
        <li>Common field notes: little robbing or wax moth activity for days after the collapse despite unreachable stores; few dead bees at the entrance; queens often present and still laying shortly before failure.</li>
        <li>Follow-up research: found no single pathogen as “the cause.” Instead, affected colonies often had multiple stressors—mite/virus pressure, pathogens, pesticide residues, inadequate forage, and transport stress—acting together.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="field-signs">
      <h2>Recognizing the CCD pattern</h2>
      <p>To classify a loss as CCD, managers looked for most of the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Acute adult worker disappearance</strong> over 1–3 weeks without piles of corpses.</li>
        <li><strong>Queen present</strong> and brood of multiple ages still in the nest.</li>
        <li><strong>Food stores intact,</strong> yet <em>delayed robbing</em> and pest invasion (unusual given unguarded honey).</li>
        <li><strong>Low adult bee population</strong> disproportionate to brood stage distribution shortly before collapse.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What CCD is not</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Starvation:</strong> Capped cells empty or only crystals; bees dead head-first in cells; often a tight cluster remaining.</li>
        <li><strong>Typical Varroa-driven crash:</strong> Bees present but weak; high mite counts; <a href="/wiki/colony-health/deformed-wing-virus.html">deformed wings</a>; spotty brood; many dead bees near the entrance during or after viral outbreaks.</li>
        <li><strong>Acute pesticide kill:</strong> Large piles of fresh dead or twitching bees at the entrance; sudden forager mortality while queen and brood initially unaffected.</li>
        <li><strong>Queen failure:</strong> Drone-layer, dwindling brood, laying workers; population declines gradually with poor brood pattern.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Contributing stressors</h2>
      <p>CCD is best understood as a <em>multifactor</em> outcome where several stressors align:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Varroa and viruses:</strong> Chronic mite loads amplify viral prevalence and weaken adult longevity. Even moderate mite levels can destabilize colonies late season without obvious deformed wings.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutritional stress:</strong> Poor forage diversity, long dearths, or protein deficits impair immune function and brood rearing.</li>
        <li><strong>Pesticide exposure:</strong> Sublethal doses can impair navigation and foraging, increasing “disappearances.” Tank mixes and contaminated wax can add chronic stress.</li>
        <li><strong>Transport and crowding:</strong> Heat, ventilation, long hauls, and high-density holding yards raise stress and pathogen spread.</li>
        <li><strong>Queen issues:</strong> Reduced pheromone signal or poor mating lowers cohesion; colonies may depopulate despite food.</li>
        <li><strong>Weather volatility:</strong> Off-cycle warm spells followed by cold snaps disrupt winter cluster and age structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Old comb &amp; residues:</strong> Accumulated contaminants and pathogens in wax increase background stress.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="diagnosis">
      <h2>Ruling in CCD vs. ruling out other causes</h2>
      <p>There is no single laboratory test for CCD. Classification rests on field evidence and exclusion of alternatives:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Document the scene:</strong> Photos of brood frames, stores, and entrance area; note number of adult bees and any dead bee piles.</li>
        <li><strong>Check mites:</strong> Use quantitative methods (alcohol wash or sugar roll) on surviving colonies and neighbors; see <a href="/wiki/colony-health/varroa-monitoring-schedule.html">Varroa monitoring schedule</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Review forage and feed:</strong> Were there recent dearths? Was protein supplement offered? Any signs of starvation?</li>
        <li><strong>Consider pesticides:</strong> Recent sprays nearby? Read your <a href="/wiki/sustainability-environment/pesticide-label-reading.html">pesticide labels</a> and region’s notification protocols; see <a href="/wiki/community-policy/pesticide-spray-notification.html">spray notifications</a> and <a href="/wiki/community-policy/pesticide-risk-management.html">risk management plans</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Assess queen and brood pattern:</strong> A healthy queen with solid brood shortly before collapse favors CCD; drone laying or scattered brood suggests queen failure.</li>
        <li><strong>Inspect comb:</strong> Age, disease signs, and wax condition; swap out dark, heavy comb as part of routine maintenance.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="mitigation">
      <h2>Mitigation that consistently helps</h2>
      <p>Regardless of whether a loss fits CCD exactly, the following practices lower risk across scenarios:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mite management via IPM:</strong> Monitor regularly and treat based on thresholds using a rotation of effective tools. See <a href="/wiki/sustainability-environment/integrated-pest-management.html">Integrated Pest Management</a> and <a href="/wiki/colony-health/varroa-treatment-honeybeehealth.html">Varroa treatment options</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutrition buffers:</strong> Plant for continuous bloom (<a href="/wiki/habitat/bee-friendly-garden-design.html">bee-friendly gardens</a>, <a href="/wiki/habitat/flower-strip-design.html">flower strips</a>, <a href="/wiki/habitat/pollinator-corridors.html">corridors</a>). In dearths, use <a href="/wiki/operations/feeding-sugar-syrup.html">syrup</a> and <a href="/wiki/operations/feeding-pollen-supplements.html">pollen supplements</a> judiciously.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduce chemical exposure:</strong> Practice pesticide stewardship, avoid contaminated wax by <a href="/wiki/operations/comb-replacement.html">replacing old comb</a>, and coordinate with neighbors on spray timing.</li>
        <li><strong>Queen and genetics:</strong> Favor <a href="/wiki/sustainability-environment/climate-adaptive-breeds.html">climate-adapted</a>, hygienic stock; requeen weak performers promptly.</li>
        <li><strong>Transport practices:</strong> For migratory operations, improve ventilation, spacing, nighttime moves, and water access to limit overheating and stress.</li>
        <li><strong>Winter configuration:</strong> Right-size the cavity, ensure ventilation and insulation where appropriate; see <a href="/wiki/sustainability-environment/energy-saving-hive.html">Insulation and Hive Efficiency</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Record-keeping:</strong> Track mite counts, feedings, queen lineage, weights (<a href="/wiki/data-sensing/hive-weight-monitoring.html">hive scales</a>), and weather notes; see <a href="/wiki/operations/record-keeping.html">Record-Keeping for Hives</a>.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="incident-response">
      <h2>If you suspect CCD: a practical response</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Secure the equipment:</strong> Close entrances to limit robbing for 24–48 hours; freeze suspect comb if moth pressure is high.</li>
        <li><strong>Consolidate resources:</strong> If brood remains viable, consider combining with a strong colony using a newspaper combine while avoiding disease transfer.</li>
        <li><strong>Sample and document:</strong> Save 50–100 bees (if available) and a comb sample for potential lab analysis; log dates and yard conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Intensify monitoring in neighbors:</strong> Increase mite checks, confirm queens, and verify feed reserves in adjacent colonies.</li>
        <li><strong>Report where applicable:</strong> Some jurisdictions encourage voluntary reporting; see <a href="/wiki/community-policy/apiary-data-reporting.html">API Data Reporting Requirements</a>.</li>

    <section id="myths">
      <h2>Myths &amp; realities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Myth:</strong> “CCD is a single new disease.” <strong>Reality:</strong> It is a syndrome—an observed pattern—likely arising from multiple interacting stressors.</li>
        <li><strong>Myth:</strong> “If bees disappear, it’s always CCD.” <strong>Reality:</strong> Starvation, queen loss, robbing, or Varroa crashes can also leave few corpses.</li>
        <li><strong>Myth:</strong> “Genetics alone prevent CCD.” <strong>Reality:</strong> Hygienic, climate-fit stock helps, but nutrition, pests, and management remain decisive.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="prevention-checklist">
      <h2>Prevention checklist</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Adopt a calendar for mite monitoring and rotate treatments to maintain efficacy.</li>
        <li>Design forage buffers for the shoulder seasons and summer dearths.</li>
        <li>Replace 20–30% of old brood comb annually to reduce residue and pathogen load.</li>
        <li>Standardize records to spot trends early (<a href="/wiki/data-sensing/smartphone-apps-beekeeping.html">apps</a> and <a href="/wiki/data-sensing/bee-farm-management-software.html">management software</a> help).</li>
        <li>Coordinate with neighbors and farmers for <a href="/wiki/community-policy/pesticide-spray-notification.html">spray notifications</a> and timing.</li>
        <li>Requeen laggards; favor queens from local, data-driven breeders.</li>
      </ul>
