      <h2>Concept in one minute</h2>
      <p>
        Varroa mites prefer drone brood because drones develop longer (24 days from egg to adult vs. ~21 for workers), giving the mites more time to reproduce. By encouraging colonies to raise drone brood on a dedicated frame and then removing that brood just after capping—before drones emerge—you physically remove a large portion of reproducing mites. Done on a schedule, this can materially lower mite pressure and delay or reduce the need for chemical treatments.

    <section id="where-it-fits">
      <h2>Where it fits in your IPM plan</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pre-season and spring:</strong> Most effective during spring buildup through early summer when colonies readily draw drone comb.</li>
        <li><strong>Alongside monitoring:</strong> Always pair with routine mite counts (e.g., sugar roll or alcohol wash). See <a href="/wiki/colony-health/varroa-monitoring-schedule.html">Varroa monitoring schedule</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>With other tactics:</strong> Combine with brood breaks, queen caging, or summer organic treatments when thresholds are exceeded.</li>
        <li><strong>Not a cure-all:</strong> It suppresses growth; it does not eradicate mites. Track numbers and act if thresholds are crossed.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="biology">
      <h2>Why drone brood works: the biology</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mite preference:</strong> Varroa are attracted to drone brood cells shortly before capping.</li>
        <li><strong>Reproductive edge:</strong> Longer drone development allows more viable daughters per foundress mite.</li>
        <li><strong>Timing window:</strong> Removal must occur after capping but before emergence; otherwise mites spread back to the colony.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="equipment">
      <h2>Equipment &amp; materials</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Drone comb foundation frame</strong> (green frames are common) or an empty frame to be drawn naturally for drones.</li>
        <li><strong>Spare drone frames</strong> to rotate (two per production colony simplifies cycles).</li>
        <li><strong>Freezer or disposal setup</strong> for capped frames (bagged and frozen; see <a href="#disposal">disposal</a>).</li>
        <li><strong>Inspection tools:</strong> Hive tool, uncapping fork/knife for sampling, and a mite monitoring kit.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="placement">
      <h2>Where to place the drone frame</h2>
      <p>
        In a Langstroth brood chamber, position the drone frame at the edge of the brood nest (e.g., position 2 or 9 in a 10-frame box) so bees will tend it but it won’t disrupt worker brood. In cold climates, avoid placing it at the extreme outer wall early in spring; move it in as the brood nest expands.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="cycle">
      <h2>Removal cycle (step-by-step)</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Introduce the frame:</strong> Add a drone foundation frame when drones are being reared naturally (check for drone brood or drone congregation flight signs). Colonies reluctant to raise drones may need better nutrition (<a href="/wiki/operations/feeding-pollen-supplements.html">pollen supplements</a>) or warmer weather.</li>
        <li><strong>Wait for capping:</strong> Inspect weekly. Drone brood caps are taller and domed. Mark the date of first capping on the top bar.</li>
        <li><strong>Remove at 14–21 days after egg laying (7–10 days after capping):</strong> This is typically just before emergence. If unsure of egg date, check larval age when first seen and calibrate for your climate. Err on the early side to be safe.</li>
        <li><strong>Freeze or uncap-and-rinse:</strong> Immediately bag and freeze for ≥24 hours, <em>or</em> uncap the frame and rinse/pressure-wash larvae and mites out of the cells (messy, do outdoors), then return the empty comb for refill.</li>
        <li><strong>Return cycle frame:</strong> Give the colony a replacement drone frame the same day to keep the trap going.</li>
        <li><strong>Repeat cycles:</strong> Continue every 3–4 weeks through the main buildup period. Stop once nectar flow ends or when mite numbers are stably below threshold.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><em>Tip:</em> Use two frames per hive and alternate them so you always have one “in” and one “in the freezer/being cleaned.”</p>
    </section>

    <section id="scheduling">
      <h2>Scheduling cheatsheet</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Day 0:</strong> Drone frame inserted.</li>
        <li><strong>Day ~9:</strong> Cells being capped (varies with temperature).</li>
        <li><strong>Day ~15–21:</strong> Remove and freeze (before emergence around Day 24).</li>
        <li><strong>Every visit:</strong> Record dates on the top bar and in your <a href="/wiki/operations/record-keeping.html">record-keeping</a> system.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="effectiveness">
      <h2>Effectiveness &amp; expectations</h2>
      <p>
        When timed correctly and paired with monitoring, drone brood removal can substantially reduce mite reproduction during spring and early summer. Typical field outcomes include slowed mite growth and delayed rise to intervention thresholds. In high-pressure areas or later in the season, you may still need soft treatments (e.g., formic/oxalic) or a brood break. See <a href="/wiki/colony-health/varroa-treatment-honeybeehealth.html">Varroa treatment options</a>.

    <section id="impacts">
      <h2>Impacts on the colony</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Resource allocation:</strong> Colonies invest wax and effort to raise drones; removal recycles those resources into more brood. Ensure ample nectar/pollen or feed if dearth is present.</li>
        <li><strong>Genetic contribution:</strong> You will reduce the colony’s male output. If you are breeding for drone contribution, limit removal to a subset of hives.</li>
        <li><strong>Comb integrity:</strong> Honey bands may be deposited above drone patches; freezing preserves comb structure for quick reuse.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="disposal">
      <h2>Disposal &amp; biosecurity</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Freezing:</strong> Freeze whole frames ≥24 hours; afterward, let them thaw and either return for bees to clean (on a strong colony during a nectar flow) or gently hose out larvae before returning.</li>
        <li><strong>Feeding to poultry:</strong> Many keepers feed frozen drone brood to chickens. Do this away from the apiary to avoid robbing behavior. Dispose of any waste securely.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid open exposure:</strong> Never leave uncapped, mite-laden brood accessible to bees or wasps; it can spread pathogens and attract robbing.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="quality">
      <h2>Quality control &amp; metrics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sampling:</strong> At each removal, scrape a small patch and note mites per 100 pupae as a rough index. Track this over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Colony metrics:</strong> Record brood pattern, stores, queen status, and temperament; suppression tactics are useless if the colony declines.</li>
        <li><strong>Threshold linkage:</strong> Tie the cadence to your <a href="/wiki/colony-health/varroa-monitoring-schedule.html">monitoring thresholds</a>. If alcohol/sugar counts exceed your action level, escalate interventions.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="troubleshooting">
      <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
      <details>
        <summary>The bees won’t draw the drone frame.</summary>
        <p>Check temperature and flow; bees draw best in a nectar flow. Move the frame slightly closer to brood, ensure queen-right status, and consider feeding thin syrup to stimulate wax production.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Frame fills with honey instead of brood.</summary>
        <p>The position may be too far from brood. Reposition to the brood nest edge. Verify queen laying pattern; a failing queen may shift brood placement.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>I missed the window; drones have emerged.</summary>
        <p>Reset the cycle immediately and tighten inspections to 7–10 days post-capping. Consider a corrective treatment if mite counts have spiked.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Excess burr/bridge comb around the drone frame.</summary>
        <p>Space frames correctly and keep the hive level. Periodically trim burr comb; ensure adequate bee space and avoid crushing bees during removal.</p>
      </details>
    </section>

    <section id="ethics">
      <h2>Ethics, welfare, and compliance</h2>
      <p>
        Drone brood removal sacrifices developing drones to protect the wider colony. Apply the method deliberately, keep cycles tight to avoid wasted effort, and dispose of brood responsibly. Follow local regulations and label requirements for any complementary treatments used later in the season.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="checklist">
      <h2>Quick checklist</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Insert one drone frame at the brood edge during spring buildup.</li>
        <li>Inspect weekly; note first capping date on the top bar.</li>
        <li>Remove 7–10 days after capping (before Day 24); freeze ≥24 hours.</li>
        <li>Swap with a second prepared frame the same day.</li>
        <li>Log mite counts and colony metrics; escalate if thresholds are exceeded.</li>
      </ul>
