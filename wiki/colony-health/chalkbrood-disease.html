      <h2>What is chalkbrood?</h2>
      <p>Chalkbrood is a fungal brood disease of honey bees caused by <em>Ascosphaera apis</em>. It primarily affects larvae, which, after infection, die and dry into white, gray, or black “mummies” that resemble pieces of chalk. Unlike foulbrood diseases, chalkbrood is generally considered a stress-related condition: colonies often recover when underlying stressors are removed and conditions are improved.</p>

    <section id="signs-symptoms">
      <h2>Field signs and symptoms</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Spotty brood pattern:</strong> scattered empty cells and irregular brood can signal brood loss.</li>
        <li><strong>“Mummies” in cells or at the entrance:</strong> hard, lightweight larval remains; white to gray when newly desiccated, often turning dark as fruiting bodies form.</li>
        <li><strong>Cell appearance:</strong> infected cells may be uncapped by workers; you may see shrunken, chalky larvae nestled loosely in the cell base.</li>
        <li><strong>Colony behavior:</strong> workers remove mummies and often pile or drop them on the bottom board or landing board.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Because mummies are distinctive, chalkbrood is typically identified visually. Laboratory confirmation is possible but not usually necessary for routine management decisions.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="lifecycle">
      <h2>Disease cycle in brief</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Exposure:</strong> spores are present on comb, in food, or in the nest environment. Larvae become infected when spores are ingested with food.</li>
        <li><strong>Germination:</strong> spores germinate in the larval gut under favorable conditions (cool, damp, stressed larvae), penetrate tissues, and kill the larva.</li>
        <li><strong>Mummification &amp; sporulation:</strong> the larva dries into a chalky mummy; fungal structures produce new spores.</li>
        <li><strong>Spread &amp; persistence:</strong> mummies shed spores that contaminate comb, bottom boards, and tools. Spores persist for years if not managed.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Environmental conditions—especially <strong>cool temperatures and high humidity</strong> in brood areas—strongly influence outbreaks. Anything that chills brood or reduces nurse bee care increases risk.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="differential">
      <h2>Rule-outs and look-alikes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>American/European foulbrood:</strong> these cause larval slumps and ropy or twisted remains with characteristic odors; they do not produce hard, chalky mummies.</li>
        <li><strong>Parasitic mite syndrome / viral brood death:</strong> often linked to high Varroa and viruses; larvae look melted or discolored rather than chalky.</li>
        <li><strong>Chilled brood (non-disease):</strong> sudden brood death after cold snaps without chalky mummies.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="risk-factors">
      <h2>Risk factors and colony stressors</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cool, damp brood nest:</strong> poor ventilation, water ingress, or prolonged cold, especially in spring.</li>
        <li><strong>Insufficient nurse bees:</strong> small adult populations relative to brood area; recent swarming or queen failure.</li>
        <li><strong>Comb condition:</strong> old or heavily contaminated comb that harbors spores.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutritional stress:</strong> low-quality pollen or dearth periods (see <a href="/wiki/habitat/year-round-forage-plan.html">Year-Round Forage Planting</a>).</li>
        <li><strong>Genetic susceptibility:</strong> some stocks show higher chalkbrood tolerance than others.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="inspection">
      <h2>Inspection and sampling tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Check <strong>entrance and bottom board</strong> for mummies—easy early indicator.</li>
        <li>Open brood frames mid-day when bees are flying to reduce chill. Look for <strong>uncapped cells with chalky larvae</strong>.</li>
        <li>Note <strong>brood coverage vs. adult population</strong>. A brood area larger than the workforce can keep warm invites problems.</li>
        <li>Record findings in your log (see <a href="/wiki/operations/record-keeping.html">Record-Keeping for Hives</a>).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="management">
      <h2>Management: integrated, practical steps</h2>

      <h3>1) Improve microclimate</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ventilation:</strong> ensure adequate, controlled airflow to remove moisture without creating drafts (see <a href="/wiki/colony-health/ventilation-and-mold.html">Hive Ventilation and Mold Control</a>).</li>
        <li><strong>Weatherproofing:</strong> repair leaks; slightly tilt hives forward so condensation drains.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduce empty space:</strong> match box count to colony size; remove empty supers early in spring.</li>
        <li><strong>Sun exposure:</strong> modest morning sun helps warm the brood nest.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2) Strengthen the workforce</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Equalize colonies:</strong> add a frame of emerging brood from a strong donor to a weak colony (ensure no disease transfer and maintain queen status).</li>
        <li><strong>Requeen if failing:</strong> poor brood patterns and low pheromone output reduce nurse bee cohesion; a vigorous queen can help stabilize the brood nest.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3) Comb hygiene</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Remove heavily affected frames:</strong> if a frame accumulates many mummies, cull or rotate it out of brood use.</li>
        <li><strong>Freeze-and-scrape:</strong> freezing contaminated comb can kill fungal growth; scrape and return only if structurally sound and lightly affected.</li>
        <li><strong>Regular rotation:</strong> adopt a schedule to cycle out old brood comb (see planned <a href="/wiki/operations/comb-replacement.html">Replacing Old Comb</a>).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4) Nutrition and timing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Support protein needs:</strong> ensure access to quality pollen; use supplements only when natural forage is lacking (see <a href="/wiki/operations/feeding-pollen-supplements.html">Feeding Pollen Supplements</a>).</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid chilling during feedings/inspections:</strong> keep brood covered; work briskly in cool weather.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5) Biosecurity and cleanliness</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clean bottom boards:</strong> remove debris and mummies promptly to limit spore buildup.</li>
        <li><strong>Tool hygiene:</strong> knock off wax/propolis and flame metal tools lightly between yards where feasible.</li>
        <li><strong>Separate problem equipment:</strong> store suspect frames and boxes apart until dealt with.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6) Treatments?</h3>
      <p>There is no universally recommended curative chemical for chalkbrood. Some jurisdictions allow products marketed for “brood diseases,” but results are mixed and may not address the root causes (temperature, humidity, colony strength). Most extension guidance prioritizes <strong>environmental correction, comb management, and stock selection</strong> over medication.</p>

    <section id="decision-guide">
      <h2>Decision guide (practical)</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Few mummies, early spring, strong nectar ahead?</strong> Improve ventilation, reduce excess space, and monitor. Many colonies self-correct.</li>
        <li><strong>Recurring mummies over several weeks?</strong> Replace worst frames; add emerging brood if understrength; check queen quality.</li>
        <li><strong>Persisting despite steps above?</strong> Consider requeening with more tolerant stock; assess site exposure (shade, damp) and move if chronically cool.</li>
        <li><strong>Severe cases with widespread contamination:</strong> Remove multiple affected frames, intensify cleaning, and temporarily reduce brood area to match the nurse bee population.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="seasonality">
      <h2>Seasonal patterns</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Spring:</strong> most common as colonies expand brood faster than bees can heat in cool, wet weather.</li>
        <li><strong>Summer:</strong> typically declines with warmth and steady forage; may flare in cool, damp microclimates or shaded sites.</li>
        <li><strong>Autumn:</strong> sporadic cases when colonies weaken or brood is chilled during manipulations.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="genetics">
      <h2>Stock differences and breeding</h2>
      <p>Chalkbrood susceptibility varies among colonies. Lines selected for hygienic behavior tend to remove diseased brood more rapidly, reducing spore production. When chronic chalkbrood affects only a subset of your apiary, <strong>requeening those colonies</strong> with hygienic or locally adapted stock is a durable solution.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="recordkeeping">
      <h2>Recordkeeping and thresholds</h2>
      <p>Track mummies seen per inspection and note weather, manipulations, and brood area. While there is no universal numeric threshold, a simple trigger is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>“Is it trending down?”</strong> If week-over-week counts and entrance debris decline after adjustments, continue current actions.</li>
        <li><strong>“Is brood pattern improving?”</strong> A tightening pattern and fewer uncapped infected cells suggest recovery.</li>
        <li><strong>“Plateau or worsening?”</strong> Escalate to comb removal and requeening steps.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="prevention">
      <h2>Prevention checklist</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Site apiaries with morning sun and good airflow (see <a href="/wiki/operations/apiary-layout-basics.html">Apiary layout basics</a>).</li>
        <li>Match brood space to colony strength; avoid leaving excess empty supers during cool spells.</li>
        <li>Maintain dry covers and sound roofs; tilt hives for drainage.</li>
        <li>Rotate out old brood comb on a schedule.</li>
        <li>Support nutrition during shoulder seasons; monitor stores (see planned <a href="/wiki/data-sensing/hive-weight-monitoring.html">Hive Weight Monitoring</a>).</li>
        <li>Favor hygienic or locally adapted queens when requeening.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="faq">
      <h2>FAQs</h2>
      <p><strong>Will chalkbrood kill a colony?</strong> Rarely by itself. However, persistent infections weaken colonies and predispose them to other problems. Addressing environment and strength typically turns the corner.</p>
      <p><strong>Can I harvest honey from a colony with chalkbrood?</strong> Yes. The fungus affects brood, not honey quality. Maintain extraction hygiene as normal.</p>
      <p><strong>Do I need to burn equipment?</strong> No, not for chalkbrood. Focus on cleaning, freezing, and comb rotation. Reserve destruction for notifiable diseases like American foulbrood according to local rules.</p>
      <p><strong>Are medications effective?</strong> Outcomes are inconsistent and may not be permitted or advisable. Improving microclimate and stock is the primary, evidence-aligned approach.</p>
