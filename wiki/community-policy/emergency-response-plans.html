      <h2>Why plan ahead?</h2>
      <p>
        Hives are exposed infrastructure. A single wildfire, flash flood, or pesticide drift event can undo a season’s work and threaten public safety. A concise, written emergency response plan (ERP) aligns people, equipment, and communication so decisions are fast and consistent under pressure. Your ERP should fit on a few pages, live both digitally and on paper in your truck, and be practiced with brief drills.
      </p>

    <section id="evac">
      <h2>Evacuation vs. shelter-in-place</h2>
      <p>
        Decide in advance which yards are relocatable and which will shelter in place. Pre-identify evacuation destinations with permission to stage pallets for 48–72 hours. Maintain an inventory of straps, screens, pallets, and a hive lifter. For shelter-in-place sites, add perimeter firebreaks, water tanks, and elevated stands.
      </p>
      <p>
        During evacuation, prioritize queenright production colonies and nucs, then mating yards, then supers ready for harvest. Keep a loading checklist on a clipboard to avoid missed lids or smokers.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="ppe">
      <h2>PPE &amp; safe approach</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Full suits, veils, and gloves for all responders; spare sets in sealed totes.</li>

        <li><strong>Power outage:</strong> protect extraction line with surge devices; use a transfer-switch-ready generator; prioritize lighting and pumps.</li>
        <li><strong>Water:</strong> keep a reserve for cleanup; add backflow prevention to protect the potable supply.</li>
        <li><strong>Fire safety:</strong> ABC extinguishers near wax melters, heaters, and doors; train staff to use them.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="records-insurance">
      <h2>Documentation, insurance &amp; compliance</h2>
      <ul>
