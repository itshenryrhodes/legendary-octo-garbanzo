      <h2>Why ethics matter in beekeeping</h2>
      <p>Keeping bees is more than managing boxes of insects. Every decision—where to place hives, how to prevent swarms, which treatments to use—affects living creatures, neighbors, native pollinators, and the reputation of beekeeping as a whole. A thoughtful ethical framework helps you navigate gray areas, communicate well, and avoid preventable harm.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="principles">
      <h2>Guiding principles</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Do no unnecessary harm.</strong> Minimize stress to bees and risk to people, pets, livestock, and wildlife.</li>
        <li><strong>Respect and transparency.</strong> Be clear about your practices, honey labeling, and hive locations where disclosure is appropriate.</li>
        <li><strong>Competence and continuous learning.</strong> Keep skills current; seek help when needed; mentor responsibly.</li>
        <li><strong>Stewardship over extraction.</strong> Prioritize colony health and local ecology over short-term yields.</li>
        <li><strong>Community-mindedness.</strong> Anticipate the social impact of your bees and act as a good neighbor.</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance.</strong> Follow applicable registration, biosecurity, and food labeling rules.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="responsibilities-to-bees">
      <h2>Responsibilities to bees</h2>
      <h3>Humane handling</h3>
      <p>Open colonies in suitable weather, use calm, minimal smoke, and avoid crushing bees. Work deliberately, not hurriedly. Handle frames over the hive to prevent queens from falling and to reduce drifting or robbing.</p>
      <h3>Nutrition and space</h3>
      <p>Provide adequate brood space and supering in nectar flows to reduce crowding pressure. When forage dearths occur, <em>feed responsibly</em> without causing robbing—use internal feeders and clean up spills immediately.</p>
      <h3>Health and biosecurity</h3>
      <p>Monitor pests and disease consistently and respond with evidence-based, least-risk measures. Use Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies first, reserving chemical treatments for when thresholds are exceeded and using them correctly to avoid resistance and contamination.</p>
      <h3>Swarm prevention and recovery</h3>
      <p>Regularly inspect during swarming season, employ proven techniques (e.g., space management, splitting) to prevent swarms, and retrieve swarms you are responsible for when safe and permitted.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="responsibilities-to-neighbors">
      <h2>Responsibilities to neighbors</h2>
      <h3>Location and flight paths</h3>
      <p>Siting hives thoughtfully prevents most conflicts. Elevate entrances above head height or direct flight through screens or hedges. Keep appropriate setbacks from property lines, play areas, and public walkways.</p>
      <h3>Water, mess, and nuisance control</h3>
      <p>Provide a reliable on-site water source so bees do not congregate at neighbors’ pools or pet bowls. Prevent robbing frenzies, tighten lids on honey buckets, and do extraction away from outdoor areas where bees could be attracted.</p>
      <h3>Communication</h3>
      <p>Proactively inform immediate neighbors about your apiary and share basic safety advice: do not block hive entrances, avoid mowing directly in front of hives, and report unusual bee activity. Offer a contact number for concerns.</p>
      <h3>Stings and risk disclosure</h3>
      <p>While occasional stings are part of beekeeping, your goal is to <em>reduce predictable risk</em>. Choose gentle stock, requeen aggressive colonies, and avoid opening hives during gatherings or windy, stormy conditions that elevate defensiveness.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="public-safety">
      <h2>Responsibilities to the public</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Visibility and signage:</strong> Use discreet “Managed Honey Bees — Do Not Disturb” signs where appropriate, without advertising hive locations that could invite tampering.</li>
        <li><strong>Secure equipment:</strong> Strap hives against wind; level stands; maintain fences or screens where needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Event management:</strong> Avoid manipulations during heavy human activity nearby. If you demonstrate beekeeping publicly, use extra smokers, extra veils, and a clear safety buffer.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="environment">
      <h2>Responsibilities to the environment</h2>
      <h3>Support local biodiversity</h3>
      <p>Plant diverse forage and avoid placing high hive densities in forage-poor landscapes where honey bees could outcompete native pollinators. Seek a balance: your bees and wild bees can coexist when flowers and nesting habitats are abundant.</p>
      <h3>Chemical mindfulness</h3>
      <p>Use hive treatments precisely as directed; never apply off-label chemicals. Store, handle, and dispose of substances so they cannot contaminate wax, honey, soil, or water.</p>
      <h3>Pest and pathogen spillover</h3>
      <p>Maintain strong, well-managed colonies to reduce disease reservoirs. Avoid exchanging comb or equipment between apiaries without sanitation. Do not sell or gift colonies with unresolved disease or mite loads.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="law-compliance">
      <h2>Compliance and fair dealing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Registration and inspections:</strong> Register apiaries where required and cooperate with health inspections. Maintain accurate, current hive locations.</li>
        <li><strong>Labeling and marketing:</strong> Label honey and hive products truthfully—botanical source claims, raw status, and allergen notices should be accurate. Avoid misleading terms.</li>
        <li><strong>Traceability:</strong> Keep batch records linking harvests to dates, yards, and supers to support quality assurance and recall readiness.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="honesty">
      <h2>Honesty in claims and education</h2>
      <p>Beekeepers often serve as ambassadors. Share practices that are supported by experience and evidence. If you are experimenting, say so. Distinguish personal preference (“I prefer top entrances in winter…”) from stronger statements (“This <em>always</em> prevents moisture issues”). Avoid overstating honey’s properties or making health claims that aren’t supported by regulations and science.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="community">
      <h2>Responsibilities to the beekeeping community</h2>
      <h3>Mentorship</h3>
      <p>Mentor new beekeepers with realistic expectations: bees can die, harvests vary, and management takes time. Encourage record-keeping and seasonal planning rather than heroics during crises.</p>
      <h3>Data sharing and privacy</h3>
      <p>Participate in citizen-science surveys or voluntary reporting programs when feasible. If you share hive data (weights, mite counts, locations), protect privacy and avoid identifying others’ yards without consent.</p>
      <h3>Fair competition</h3>
      <p>Market honey and nucleus colonies honestly. Do not disparage other beekeepers or undercut standards by ignoring labeling or health rules. Healthy competition improves quality; corner-cutting harms everyone.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="conflicts">
      <h2>Handling conflicts and complaints</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Listen first.</strong> A neighbor’s concern about “bees at the pool” may indicate your water supply failed.</li>
        <li><strong>Respond promptly.</strong> Adjust flight-path screens, relocate hives within the yard, increase forage, or reduce colony numbers if appropriate.</li>
        <li><strong>Document.</strong> Keep brief notes on complaints and actions taken. Documentation shows diligence if disputes escalate.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="migratory-and-moving">
      <h2>Migratory and moving colonies</h2>
      <p>When transporting bees, secure loads, comply with movement permits, and prevent drift or absconding at new sites. Coordinate with landowners and nearby beekeepers to avoid overcrowding and to respect existing forage arrangements. Night moves minimize bee loss; provide water and shade upon arrival.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="checklists">
      <h2>Ethics-in-action checklists</h2>

      <h3>Before placing hives</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Confirm local registration and setback requirements.</li>
        <li>Verify adequate forage and water; plan a permanent water source.</li>
        <li>Design flight corridors (screens, hedges, or orientation) away from human traffic.</li>
        <li>Discuss bees with immediate neighbors and share a contact number.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Routine management</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Inspect on an interval matched to season and colony strength.</li>
        <li>Monitor mites and diseases with documented methods; act on thresholds.</li>
        <li>Super early in flows; reduce entrances during dearth or robbing pressure.</li>
        <li>Requeen aggressive colonies promptly; keep gentle stock as your default.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Harvest and marketing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Remove and extract honey in bee-tight spaces; prevent robbing at the yard.</li>
        <li>Keep extraction, filtering, and bottling sanitary and traceable.</li>
        <li>Label honestly (varietal, raw, origin) and include allergen advisories where applicable.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>When things go wrong</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Respond to swarms, defensive behavior, or suspected pesticide incidents quickly.</li>
        <li>Notify relevant contacts (neighbor, landowner) and, when appropriate, authorities.</li>
        <li>Record facts: weather, bloom conditions, chemical applications nearby, and your actions.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="common-pitfalls">
      <h2>Common pitfalls to avoid</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Over-hiving a location.</strong> Too many colonies in scant forage increases robbing, disease pressure, and neighbor complaints.</li>
        <li><strong>Ignoring temperament.</strong> Persistently hot colonies damage community goodwill—requeen.</li>
        <li><strong>Messy feeding or extracting.</strong> Spills train bees to associate human spaces with food.</li>
        <li><strong>Skipping records.</strong> Without notes, patterns are missed and problems repeat.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="template">
      <h2>A simple personal ethics statement (example)</h2>
      <p>You can adapt the following as a one-paragraph commitment for your club or website:</p>
      <blockquote>
        I keep honey bees with respect for their biology, my neighbors, and the wider environment. I monitor colony health and use the least-risk tools first. I manage swarming responsibly, provide water and forage, and maintain gentle stock. I comply with registration, labeling, and inspection requirements, and I label products honestly. I respond promptly to concerns, document my practices, and contribute to the beekeeping community with integrity.
      </blockquote>
