      <h2>What is an apiary inspection?</h2>
      <p>An apiary inspection is a formal visit by an authorized officer—typically from an agriculture department or a designated inspection program—to check hive health, verify compliance with disease control rules, and confirm that movement, sale, or pollination contracts won’t spread pests and pathogens. Inspections protect the broader beekeeping community by catching issues early and ensuring consistent hygiene standards.</p>
      <p>Inspections may be routine (scheduled for a region or season), triggered (before interstate movement, sales, or pollination), or complaint-based (after a report of disease, neglected hives, or nuisance). The tone is professional and practical: inspectors want accurate information, safe working conditions, and cooperative handling of colonies.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="scope">
      <h2>Scope: what inspectors typically look for</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Visible pests and diseases:</strong> symptoms of <em>American foulbrood</em>, <em>European foulbrood</em>, chalkbrood, stonebrood, <em>Varroa destructor</em> load, deformed wings, small hive beetle, and wax moth pressure. See <a href="/wiki/colony-health/varroa-monitoring-schedule.html">Varroa monitoring schedule</a> and <a href="/wiki/colony-health/hygienic-behaviour-testing.html">Hygienic behaviour testing</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Colony condition:</strong> brood pattern quality, queen-right status, population strength, stores, and ventilation.</li>
        <li><strong>Biosecurity &amp; hygiene:</strong> cleanliness of equipment, how deadouts and contaminated materials are handled, and separation of suspect colonies.</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance artifacts:</strong> registration numbers or yard IDs (where required), movement permits, sales certificates, and any treatment logs for medications/miticides.</li>
        <li><strong>Site factors:</strong> safe access, water provision, and measures to reduce public exposure or nuisance. See <a href="/wiki/operations/apiary-layout-basics.html">Apiary layout basics</a>.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="prep">
      <h2>Preparation checklist (quick wins)</h2>
      <p>Most findings are preventable with light, consistent preparation. A week before an expected visit, work through this list:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Health snapshot:</strong> sample mites and record counts; note any symptomatic brood. File results with the date. (Cross-reference your <a href="/wiki/operations/first-inspection-checklist.html">First inspection checklist</a>.)</li>
        <li><strong>Records folder:</strong> keep a single folder (digital or binder) containing:
          <ul>
            <li>Apiary registration proof (where applicable). See <a href="/wiki/community-policy/apiary-registration.html">Apiary Registration Requirements</a>.</li>
            <li>Colony inventory: number of hives by yard, queen status where known.</li>
            <li>Treatment log: product, dose, dates, lot numbers, and withdrawal periods.</li>
            <li>Movement/pollination paperwork and any sales certificates.</li>
            <li>Contact details and emergency plan for pesticide spraying. See <a href="/wiki/community-policy/pesticide-spray-notification.html">Pesticide Application Notification</a>.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Yard hygiene:</strong> remove old burr comb and honey spills; secure exposed cappings; store drawn comb against wax moths.</li>
        <li><strong>Access &amp; safety:</strong> clear approaches for vehicles, mow or trim vegetation around stands, and set up a staging area for supers and tools.</li>
        <li><strong>Mark suspect hives:</strong> cluster weak or symptomatic colonies and mark them for separate handling and re-checks.</li>
        <li><strong>Water source:</strong> ensure a clean, attractive water supply is present and easy to show.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="records">
      <h2>Records that make inspections smooth</h2>
      <p>Consistency and clarity matter more than format. Aim for a one-page view of each yard and a rolling log of health and treatments.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Yard sheet:</strong> yard ID, location, number of colonies, last inspection date, any special notes (recent splits, requeens).</li>
        <li><strong>Colony log excerpt:</strong> date, queen status, brood pattern rating, mite count method and result, action taken.</li>
        <li><strong>Treatment log:</strong> product name, active ingredient, lot number, start/end dates, temperature notes, and any observed effects (e.g., bearding).</li>
        <li><strong>Movement log:</strong> dates, sources/destinations, certificate numbers if required, and biosecurity steps taken.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Good records help demonstrate due diligence. They also inform better timing for supering, feeding, and winter prep. See <a href="/wiki/operations/winter-prep-checklist.html">Winter prep checklist</a> and <a href="/wiki/operations/feeding-basics.html">Feeding basics</a> for seasonal tie-ins.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="day-of">
      <h2>Day-of protocol: walk-through</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Meet and brief:</strong> greet the inspector, confirm which yards/hives they plan to open, and identify the staging area and water source.</li>
        <li><strong>PPE and smoke:</strong> provide spare veils and light smoke; demonstrate calm handling and standard tool placement.</li>
        <li><strong>Open representative hives:</strong> inspectors may select by strength or at random. Move deliberately: outer frames first, then brood nest. Point out brood pattern, eggs/larvae, and any anomalies.</li>
        <li><strong>Sampling and photos:</strong> allow mite sampling or swabs where authorized; inspectors may take photographs of frames or equipment for reports.</li>
        <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> show registration proof, movement permits, and logs. Keep originals safe; offer copies or digital exports.</li>
        <li><strong>Debrief:</strong> clarify preliminary observations, ask about recommended actions and timelines, and confirm how the official report will arrive.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="rights-obligations">
      <h2>Your rights and obligations</h2>
      <p>Inspections are cooperative by design, but you retain reasonable expectations around safety, scope, and property care. Typical boundaries include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Scope:</strong> inspections relate to bee health, disease control, and compliance artifacts; unrelated searches are out of scope.</li>
        <li><strong>Safety first:</strong> you may postpone opening hives in dangerous weather or during severe dearth if it would unduly jeopardize colonies or people. Offer alternative times promptly.</li>
        <li><strong>Biosecurity:</strong> you can request clean gloves/tools for suspect yards and provide a disinfectant station.</li>
        <li><strong>Record privacy:</strong> provide what’s required by rule; redact unrelated personal data if documents combine business and private notes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If unsure, ask the inspector to cite the specific rule or program guideline. Most will explain willingly.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="common-findings">
      <h2>Common findings—and fast fixes</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>High Varroa load without documented sampling</dt>
        <dd>Adopt a consistent sampling schedule (alcohol wash or sugar roll), log results, and implement integrated controls. See <a href="/wiki/colony-health/varroa-monitoring-schedule.html">Varroa monitoring schedule</a>.</dd>

        <dt>Inadequate treatment records</dt>
        <dd>Record product, dose, dates, and lot number; keep packaging photos. Note temperature and colony behavior during treatment.</dd>

        <dt>Untidy yard attracting robbing</dt>
        <dd>Secure cappings and wet comb; close exposed honey; reduce entrances for weak units. See <a href="/wiki/operations/swarm-signs-and-prevention.html">Swarm signs &amp; prevention</a> for congestion cues linked to robbing risk.</dd>

        <dt>Equipment with disease risk</dt>
        <dd>Isolate suspect boxes; label and store off the ground; consider rendering or sterilization protocols depending on the diagnosis.</dd>

        <dt>Insufficient water provision</dt>
        <dd>Add a nearby, textured water source with frequent refills to prevent nuisance foraging.</dd>
      </dl>
    </section>

    <section id="corrective">
      <h2>Corrective actions and timelines</h2>
      <p>If an issue is noted, inspectors may set a timeframe to remediate and request proof (photos, receipts, follow-up visit). A pragmatic sequence:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Stabilize high-risk items first:</strong> suspected AFB, severe mite loads, or widespread robbing; separate, contain, or treat immediately.</li>
        <li><strong>Document:</strong> write down what you did, when, and the materials used; attach photos of frames and entrances.</li>
        <li><strong>Follow-up sampling:</strong> repeat mite counts or diagnostic swabs; log results to show improvement.</li>
        <li><strong>Confirm closure:</strong> send requested proof or schedule the re-inspection promptly.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="special-cases">
      <h2>Special cases</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Moving bees for pollination:</strong> expect emphasis on pest status and proof of origin, plus coordination on pesticide notifications. Keep copies of contracts and movement permits with the yard file.</li>
        <li><strong>Buying/selling nucs or queens:</strong> maintain health certificates where required and a clean mating yard plan; track queen lineage where possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Organic or low-treatment operations:</strong> inspectors may ask about your IPM plan, thresholds, and non-chemical controls; logs should still show sampling and decisions.</li>
        <li><strong>Suspected pesticide incidents:</strong> preserve evidence (dead bees, photos, weather data), notify authorities promptly, and record lot applications nearby. See <a href="/wiki/community-policy/apiary-data-reporting.html">API Data Reporting Requirements</a>.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="biosecurity">
      <h2>Biosecurity protocol for inspection days</h2>
      <p>Demonstrating clean practice builds trust and reduces cross-yard spread:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide disposable gloves or sanitizer for the inspector; offer spare hive tools you can disinfect afterward.</li>
        <li>Open healthy, typical colonies first; leave suspect units for last and handle them in a contained workflow.</li>
        <li>Bag any debris and seal cappings promptly; keep wax moth-prone materials in closed containers.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="communication">
      <h2>Communication that helps everyone</h2>
      <p>Inspectors appreciate concise, accurate information. A simple yard map, a current inventory, and a brief season summary (major flows, setbacks, requeens, and feeding) go a long way. Invite feedback: “Is there anything we should change to align better with program guidelines?”</p>
    </section>

    <section id="building-ahead">
      <h2>Building an inspection-ready apiary—year round</h2>
      <p>Think of inspection readiness as good beekeeping:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep a predictable inspection rhythm and record outcomes—even “no action needed.”</li>
        <li>Super early to manage congestion, and refresh comb on a rolling schedule to lower disease risk.</li>
        <li>Stage equipment so lifting and ventilation are easy; standardize entrances and landmarks to reduce drifting.</li>
        <li>Prepare for seasons: spring buildup and swarming pressure, summer honey handling, autumn consolidation, and winter moisture control.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="faq">
      <h2>FAQs</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Do I have to open every hive?</dt>
        <dd>No. Inspectors typically examine a representative subset, plus any units with visible issues.</dd>

        <dt>What if weather turns bad?</dt>
        <dd>Safety comes first. Offer to reschedule or limit openings to the strongest colonies if temperatures or wind make it risky.</dd>

        <dt>Can I provide digital records?</dt>
        <dd>Yes. Keep printable exports available. Consistency and clarity are the key expectations.</dd>

        <dt>Will I be fined?</dt>
        <dd>Programs emphasize remediation over punishment. Fines are usually reserved for non-cooperation or repeated, serious violations.</dd>
