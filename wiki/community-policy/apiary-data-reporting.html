      <h2>What this page covers (and what it doesn’t)</h2>
      <p>
        This page explains the typical <em>types</em> of information a beekeeper may be asked to submit to public agencies or industry programs, plus practical ways to prepare, collect, and transmit those data. It is jurisdiction-agnostic and does not offer legal advice; always check your local or national authority for specific rules and deadlines. Use this as a blueprint to build a lean, repeatable reporting workflow that also improves day-to-day management.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="why">
      <h2>Why reporting exists</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Public animal health surveillance:</strong> Detect outbreaks of notifiable diseases (e.g., American foulbrood) and track parasite trends such as Varroa.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk management:</strong> Inform pesticide application windows, pollination contracts, and movement controls.</li>
        <li><strong>Evidence for policy:</strong> Loss and health data shape guidance, extension funding, and research priorities.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Done well, reporting returns value to beekeepers: regional risk alerts, better extension materials, and more realistic timelines for interventions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="programs">
      <h2>Common reporting programs and triggers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Annual or seasonal loss surveys:</strong> Self-reported winter and in-season mortality, colony counts, and management factors.</li>
        <li><strong>Notifiable disease reporting:</strong> Mandatory notification if you suspect specific diseases or pests identified by your authority.</li>
        <li><strong>Movement and registration updates:</strong> Apiary registration changes, hive movements across borders, or pollination placement declarations.</li>
        <li><strong>Pesticide incident reporting:</strong> Suspected pesticide kills or sublethal effects near treated crops (see <a href="/wiki/community-policy/pesticide-incident-reporting.html">Reporting Pesticide Incidents</a>).</li>
        <li><strong>Program-specific monitoring:</strong> Voluntary initiatives requesting standardized Varroa counts, pathogen screening, or nutrition metrics to produce regional dashboards.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="dataset">
      <h2>The core dataset most programs ask for</h2>
      <p>Typical fields are predictable. If you standardize how you collect these, most forms become “fill and ship.”</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Operation profile:</strong> Beekeeper ID/registration number, contact details, scale (number of colonies).</li>
        <li><strong>Apiary locations:</strong> Site IDs and coarse location (e.g., county/region or lat/long with optional obfuscation for privacy).</li>
        <li><strong>Colony counts by period:</strong> Start-of-season, end-of-season, splits made, merges, and purchases.</li>
        <li><strong>Losses:</strong> Winter and in-season losses, suspected causes (starvation, queen failure, Varroa-associated, pesticides, unknown).</li>
        <li><strong>Varroa monitoring:</strong> Methods (alcohol wash, sugar roll, sticky board), sample size, counts (% infestation) by month (see <a href="/wiki/colony-health/varroa-monitoring-schedule.html">Varroa monitoring schedule</a>).</li>
        <li><strong>Disease diagnostics:</strong> Positive results or strong suspicions for notifiable diseases (see <a href="/wiki/colony-health/colony-diagnostics-tests.html">Colony Diagnostic Tests</a> and <a href="/wiki/colony-health/american-foulbrood.html">American Foulbrood Disease</a>).</li>
        <li><strong>Treatments:</strong> Active ingredients, timing, reason (threshold-based, calendar, emergency), and application method (link to <a href="/wiki/colony-health/varroa-treatment-honeybeehealth.html">Varroa Treatment</a>).</li>
        <li><strong>Nutrition and forage:</strong> Feeding events (syrup, fondant, pollen patties), dearth notes, and significant forage changes (see <a href="/wiki/habitat/planting-for-pollinators.html">Planting for pollinators</a>).</li>
        <li><strong>Pollination services:</strong> Crop types, placement windows, and observed risks.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Keep the dataset <em>minimal but longitudinal</em>: fewer fields, recorded consistently, are more powerful than sporadic detail.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="workflow">
      <h2>Build a reporting workflow that runs itself</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Define your master schema:</strong> Mirror the fields above in a single spreadsheet or app profile. Use consistent names and units (e.g., Varroa as “mites/100 bees”). See <a href="/wiki/data-sensing/data-management-practices.html">Data Management for Beekeepers</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose your capture tools:</strong> Paper cards, a phone app, or both. If you are new, start with a one-page card clipped to each yard and transcribe weekly. See <a href="/wiki/operations/record-keeping.html">Record-Keeping for Hives</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Set inspection cadence:</strong> Weekly in buildup, biweekly in shoulder seasons. Align Varroa counts with your <a href="/wiki/colony-health/varroa-monitoring-schedule.html">monitoring schedule</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Monthly consolidation:</strong> Roll apiary cards into the master sheet at month-end; run simple checks (missing values, outliers).</li>
        <li><strong>Quarterly snapshots:</strong> Export the fields that external programs typically ask for (counts, losses, Varroa, treatments).</li>
        <li><strong>Submission binder:</strong> Keep PDF exports, submission confirmations, and any case numbers for disease or incident reports.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        If you already use digital systems, map your fields once and stick to them. Small operations can still benefit from a simple, printable template (see example below).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="template">
      <h2>Example minimal data template</h2>
      <p>Use this as your “always-there” sheet on a clipboard or as columns in your app/spreadsheet.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Apiary ID · County/Region</li>
        <li>Date · Weather (brief) · Bloom notes</li>
        <li>Colonies inspected · Colonies alive</li>
        <li>Varroa check? (Y/N) · Method · Result (mites/100 bees)</li>
        <li>Queen status (seen, eggs, pattern)</li>
        <li>Treatments this period (AI, dose, reason)</li>
        <li>Losses this period (count) · Suspected cause</li>
        <li>Feeding (type/amount) · Dearth notes</li>
        <li>Incidents (pesticide exposure, vandalism, bears)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="quality">
      <h2>Data quality &amp; defensibility</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Standardize methods:</strong> Use the same Varroa method each time for trend comparability; note deviations.</li>
        <li><strong>Time-stamp and sign:</strong> For paper cards, initial each line. For apps, ensure automatic timestamps are visible.</li>
        <li><strong>Chain of evidence:</strong> Keep photos of diagnostic frames, test strips, and sample labels for notifiable disease cases.</li>
        <li><strong>Version control:</strong> Don’t overwrite raw entries; append corrections with a short reason (“transcription fix”).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="privacy">
      <h2>Privacy, location precision, and sharing</h2>
      <p>
        Reporting programs balance surveillance with beekeeper privacy. A practical rule is to store <em>precise</em> coordinates in your private records, then supply the <em>minimum required</em> public precision (e.g., county or rounded lat/long) unless law requires exact points. If contributing to open dashboards (see <a href="/wiki/data-sensing/open-data-beekeeping.html">Open Data in Beekeeping</a>), verify how location is generalized and who can view it.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Obfuscation:</strong> Round coordinates to ~1–5 km for public maps unless exact is required for control zones.</li>
        <li><strong>Data separation:</strong> Keep your contact list and customer details in a separate file from health datasets.</li>
        <li><strong>Access logs:</strong> If you use online forms, confirm who can read submissions and how long they’re retained.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="formats">
      <h2>Submission formats and tips</h2>
      <p>
        Most programs accept web forms, email attachments (CSV/PDF), or occasional paper mail-ins. A few accept API or app-to-app uploads via partner platforms. To speed your work:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Keep a “report-ready” export view:</strong> Pre-filter your sheet to the fields programs request.</li>
        <li><strong>Use consistent file names:</strong> <code>YYYY-MM_ApiarySummary_YourName.csv</code> and <code>…_LossSurvey.pdf</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>Readable PDF:</strong> If forms are scanned, use high contrast and a dark pen; attach photos as separate files when allowed.</li>
        <li><strong>Confirm receipt:</strong> Save auto-receipts or email replies to your submission binder.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="special">
      <h2>Special cases and decision points</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Suspected notifiable disease</dt>
        <dd>
          Isolate suspect hives, limit robbing, and follow your authority’s notification pathway immediately. Keep photos and sample IDs. Review <a href="/wiki/colony-health/colony-diagnostics-tests.html">Colony Diagnostic Tests</a>.
        </dd>

        <dt>Pollination contracts</dt>
        <dd>
          Growers may request pre-placement Varroa counts, queen status, and loss history. Provide only the agreed fields; keep full records privately.
        </dd>

        <dt>Pesticide incidents</dt>
        <dd>
          Document rapidly: wide and close photos, dead bee samples, weather, spray times, applicator contact if known. File an incident report (see <a href="/wiki/community-policy/pesticide-incident-reporting.html">Reporting Pesticide Incidents</a>) and notify neighbors (see <a href="/wiki/community-policy/pesticide-spray-notification.html">Pesticide Application Notification</a>).
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </section>

    <section id="automation">
      <h2>Lightweight automation (optional)</h2>
      <p>
        Without getting “too tech,” you can gain reliability with small automations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Calendar nudges:</strong> Reminders for monthly consolidations and seasonal survey windows.</li>
        <li><strong>Drop-in forms:</strong> A single mobile form that logs to your master sheet with standardized dropdowns.</li>
        <li><strong>Device data:</strong> If you use hive scales or sensors (see <a href="/wiki/data-sensing/hive-weight-monitoring.html">Hive Weight Monitoring</a> and <a href="/wiki/data-sensing/hive-temperature-humidity-sensors.html">Hive Temperature and Humidity Sensors</a>), export monthly summaries and attach them to your binder.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="checklist">
      <h2>Pre-submission checklist</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>All apiaries listed with consistent IDs and regions.</li>
        <li>Colony counts balanced (start + splits − losses ± sales = end).</li>
        <li>At least one Varroa data point per month in buildup months (method noted).</li>
        <li>Treatments logged with active ingredient and reason.</li>
        <li>Any disease positives documented with photo or lab ref.</li>
        <li>Files exported in the requested format; submission receipt saved.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="faq">
      <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>What if I don’t know a cause of loss?</dt>
        <dd>Use “unknown” rather than guessing. Add a short note—e.g., “light stores; Varroa not checked since Aug.”</dd>

        <dt>Do small backyard beekeepers have to report?</dt>
        <dd>Sometimes only for notifiable diseases or if registered; some surveys are voluntary. Check your local rules; voluntary data are still valuable for regional pictures.</dd>

        <dt>Will sharing locations increase theft risk?</dt>
        <dd>Share the minimum precision required publicly. Keep exact coordinates private unless control measures require them.</dd>

        <dt>How do I stay consistent across seasons?</dt>
        <dd>Lock your schema, keep methods the same, and use a monthly consolidation habit. Consistency beats complexity.</dd>
