      <h2>Why placement matters</h2>
      <p>Where you place hives determines safety, flight lines, community relations, and even colony performance. Many jurisdictions publish ordinance guidance for setbacks, fencing, and water provision, especially in residential or mixed-use areas. While the exact rules vary by city or region, the practical aims are consistent: keep bees’ flight paths above head level, avoid nuisance, ensure reliable water nearby, and provide safe access for you and any inspectors.</p>
      <p>This guide distills common expectations and proven practices. Treat it as a siting checklist and a conversation starter with neighbors or officials. For layout fundamentals, see <a href="/wiki/operations/apiary-layout-basics.html">Apiary layout basics</a> and <a href="/wiki/habitat/planting-for-pollinators.html">Planting for pollinators</a>.</p>

    <section id="setbacks">
      <h2>Setbacks (typical ranges and intent)</h2>
      <p>Setbacks are minimum distances from hive entrances to boundaries or human activity. The purpose is to lift and direct flight paths away from walkways and shared spaces.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Property lines:</strong> Aim for <em>3–6 m</em> (10–20 ft) from the nearest boundary. In tighter urban yards, combine shorter setbacks with a <em>2 m</em> (6–7 ft) solid screen or hedge to push bees upward immediately after takeoff.</li>
        <li><strong>Public sidewalks and play areas:</strong> Target <em>6–10 m</em> (20–33 ft). If space is limited, prioritize screening and orient entrances toward internal green space rather than traffic.</li>
        <li><strong>Roads and driveways:</strong> Keep entrances <em>10+ m</em> (33+ ft) from vehicle lanes and orient flight lines away from vehicles to prevent collisions with wind eddies and mirrors.</li>
        <li><strong>Neighbor doors, patios, animal runs:</strong> Maximize distance and shielding. Even calm colonies can drift toward scented food, barbecue smoke, or pet activity.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When local ordinances specify exact numbers, follow those. Where they do not, document your intent: a quick sketch showing distances, screens, and entrances goes a long way during inspections or neighbor chats. See <a href="/wiki/community-policy/neighbor-relations.html">Managing Neighbor Relations</a> for outreach tips.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="orientation">
      <h2>Entrance orientation and flight lines</h2>
      <p>Direct entrances toward open space and forage. Avoid aiming bees at the property edge or busy paths. A simple re-angle of stands by 30–60° can dramatically reduce crossings over foot traffic. Wind and sun also matter: morning sun helps colonies start early; avoid strong prevailing winds funneling into entrances.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Height:</strong> Stands at 30–45 cm (12–18 in) reduce dampness and encourage upward flight. In urban areas, a <em>2 m</em> screen right in front of entrances forces a vertical takeoff.</li>
        <li><strong>Landmarks:</strong> Distinctive visual cues (hedges, trellises, painted boxes) reduce drifting between hives and keep traffic predictable.</li>
        <li><strong>Bee lines:</strong> Keep the “runway” clear of human activity for at least 3–4 m (10–13 ft) directly in front of the entrance.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If swarming pressure increases, more bee traffic can alarm neighbors. Combine good siting with timely supering and space management. See <a href="/wiki/operations/swarm-signs-and-prevention.html">Swarm signs &amp; prevention</a> and <a href="/wiki/operations/honey-supering.html">Adding Supers (Supering)</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="screening">
      <h2>Screening, fencing, and hedging</h2>
      <p>Most nuisance complaints arise from low, direct bee traffic crossing human space. Solid barriers near entrances fix this.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Height:</strong> A <em>1.8–2.4 m</em> (6–8 ft) fence, wall, or dense hedge immediately in front of entrances lifts flight above head height.</li>
        <li><strong>Distance:</strong> Place the barrier <em>1–2 m</em> (3–6 ft) from the stands; too close can cause eddies and drifting, too far loses the lift effect.</li>
        <li><strong>Materials:</strong> Solid wood fencing, privacy screens, reed panels, or evergreen hedges. Combine with trellised flowering vines to stack function—screening plus forage.</li>
        <li><strong>Corners and gates:</strong> Prevent “blind turns” at human height. If a path must pass near hives, use an L-shaped screen so walkers don’t emerge suddenly into the flight path.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="water">
      <h2>Water provision (nuisance prevention)</h2>
      <p>Bees will choose the closest consistent water source. If you don’t provide one, they may pick the neighbor’s pool, AC drip, or pet bowl.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Provide attractive water:</strong> A rough-surfaced basin with stones, corks, or wood floats prevents drowning and wicks mineral flavors that bees prefer over pure water.</li>
        <li><strong>Placement:</strong> Set water <em>between the hives and any boundary</em>, slightly closer to the hives than to the fence, so the bees “discover” it first.</li>
        <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Top up daily in hot weather. Algae is fine; it helps scent the source.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Tie this to your yard plan and pesticide alerts. See <a href="/wiki/community-policy/pesticide-spray-notification.html">Pesticide Application Notification</a> for coordinating spray days and protecting water sources.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="access">
      <h2>Access, safety, and operations</h2>
      <p>Even good setbacks fail if you can’t work the yard safely. Plan for routine inspections, harvest, and emergency response.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Working aisle:</strong> Keep a clear <em>1 m</em> (3–4 ft) behind the hives to set supers and tools.</li>
        <li><strong>Stable stands:</strong> Level, non-sinking stands reduce comb cross-building and make inspections calmer. Avoid placing stands directly on shared walls or fences that transmit vibration.</li>
        <li><strong>Vehicle and dolly access:</strong> You’ll appreciate simple honey moves and quick exits during storms or neighborhood events.</li>
        <li><strong>Signage:</strong> A discreet sign at the yard entry—“Managed Apiary: Do Not Disturb”—helps delivery crews, landscapers, and visitors avoid surprises.</li>
        <li><strong>Emergency egress:</strong> Avoid boxed-in corners; keep a secondary path if bees become defensive.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="scale">
      <h2>How many hives per site?</h2>
      <p>Ordinances sometimes cap hive counts by lot size. Even where they don’t, a practical density improves forage balance and neighbor comfort.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Small urban lots (&lt; 500 m² / 0.12 ac):</strong> Start with <em>2–3 hives</em> max, positioned as a single cluster with screening.</li>
        <li><strong>Suburban lots (500–2,000 m² / 0.12–0.5 ac):</strong> <em>3–6 hives</em>, split into two pods if line-of-sight to neighbors is unavoidable.</li>
        <li><strong>Acreage:</strong> Expand in 4–6 hive pods with internal flight lines and wind breaks; avoid lining up long rows pointing at roads.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Scale gradually and monitor temperament, drift, and forage dearth. Add supers early to manage congestion (a big neighbor-pleaser in nectar flow).</p>
    </section>

    <section id="season">
      <h2>Seasonal adjustments</h2>
      <p>Siting is not one-and-done. Revisit the plan seasonally:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Add or rotate screens if path usage changes (kids outside, garden parties). Prepare for higher flight volume.</li>
        <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Shade options for heat waves; ensure water stays closer and more attractive than pools. Manage honey handling out of sight and seal cappings promptly.</li>
        <li><strong>Autumn:</strong> Reduce entrances for weak colonies; clean up robbing triggers; re-balance yard if moving equipment for harvest.</li>
        <li><strong>Winter:</strong> Wind breaks become critical; keep entrances above snow lines; maintain safe access during ice.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="policy-fit">
      <h2>Fitting your plan to local rules</h2>
      <p>Before placing hives, check whether your area requires <a href="/wiki/community-policy/apiary-registration.html">apiary registration</a> or explicit setbacks and fencing. If you’re in a dense area, skim <a href="/wiki/community-policy/zoning-and-urban-laws.html">Beekeeping and Zoning Laws</a> for typical constraints and variance paths. Keep a one-page site plan to show inspectors or HOAs:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Map of lot with dimensions.</li>
        <li>Hive locations, entrances, and flight vectors.</li>
        <li>Setback distances annotated.</li>
        <li>Screening and vegetation.</li>
        <li>Water source and access routes.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>If pesticide spraying is common nearby, add your notification protocol and emergency steps; see <a href="/wiki/community-policy/pesticide-spray-notification.html">Pesticide Application Notification</a>.</p>

    <section id="troubleshooting">
      <h2>Troubleshooting common siting issues</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Bees visiting neighbor pools or pet bowls</dt>
        <dd>Move your water source closer to the hives than any external sources, spike with a pinch of sea salt, and add floating wicks. Keep it consistent for a week.</dd>

        <dt>Low, head-height flight paths across a footpath</dt>
        <dd>Add a 2 m privacy screen or hedged trellis 1–2 m in front of entrances to force an upward departure.</dd>

        <dt>Drifting and hot spots at the yard edge</dt>
        <dd>Stagger entrances, vary box colors, and add mid-yard landmarks (shrubs, trellises). Rotate the outermost entrances slightly inward.</dd>

        <dt>Defensive behavior near boundary during dearth</dt>
        <dd>Shorten grass, remove attractants, reduce entrances of weak units, and avoid opening hives in windy, stormy, or cold snaps. If needed, temporarily re-orient entrances away from the boundary.</dd>

    <section id="do-dont">
      <h2>Do &amp; Don’t (quick reference)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Do</strong> lift flight paths with screens or hedges where setbacks are short.</li>
        <li><strong>Do</strong> provide reliable, attractive water closer than any offsite sources.</li>
        <li><strong>Do</strong> orient entrances into internal green space and away from foot traffic.</li>
        <li><strong>Do</strong> document your plan—map, setbacks, and records—so inspections go smoothly.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t</strong> point entrances at a boundary, gate, dog run, or play area.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t</strong> leave honey supers, wet frames, or cappings exposed where neighbors can see or smell them.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t</strong> exceed practical density for the lot; add supers early during flow.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="faqs">
      <h2>FAQs</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>My lot is tiny. Can I still keep bees?</dt>
        <dd>Yes—often with screening and strict water management. Many small-lot beekeepers succeed with two hives placed 10–15 ft from boundaries plus a 2 m screen.</dd>

        <dt>Are hedges as good as fences?</dt>
        <dd>Dense evergreen hedges work well if they reach ~2 m and have minimal gaps. Combine with a trellis during establishment.</dd>

        <dt>What if rules conflict with practical siting?</dt>
        <dd>Speak with your local authority about a variance using your site plan. Offer mitigations (higher screens, reduced hive count) and a neighbor letter of support.</dd>
