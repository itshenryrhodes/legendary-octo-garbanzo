      <h2>Why keep bees in and around forests?</h2>
      <p>
        Forest landscapes provide a mosaic of nectar and pollen sources across seasons, cooler summer microclimates, and natural windbreaks. Diverse woodland edges—where canopy, shrubs, and herbaceous layers meet—often deliver steady forage, especially when nearby agriculture or urban areas are chemically intensive or sparse in bloom. Well-sited apiaries can also support broader conservation goals by encouraging native plantings, controlling invasive species, and restoring structural diversity that benefits many pollinators—not just honey bees.

    <section id="site-selection">
      <h2>Site selection: balancing shade, sun, and access</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Light &amp; aspect:</strong> Aim for <em>filtered morning sun</em> with partial shade in the hottest part of the day. Direct, all-day shade often keeps colonies too cool and damp; full sun can overheat hives in heat waves.</li>
        <li><strong>Drainage:</strong> Choose <em>well-drained</em> ground above low spots that trap cold air and fog. Elevate hives on sturdy stands to keep floors dry and reduce mould.</li>
        <li><strong>Wind &amp; canopy:</strong> Use natural windbreaks (boulders, evergreen thickets) without parking hives directly under large limbs that could drop in storms. Avoid tight canopy that blocks flight paths.</li>
        <li><strong>Access &amp; logistics:</strong> Ensure year-round vehicle or cart access for feeding, extraction, and emergency response. Consider seasonal road closures, mud, and snowpack.</li>
        <li><strong>Water:</strong> Provide a reliable, shallow water source with landing surfaces (pebbles, cork) <em>inside</em> the apiary boundary to prevent risky flights to streams or neighbour features.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="wildlife-safety">
      <h2>Wildlife safety and risk management</h2>
      <p>
        Forest apiaries intersect with wildlife corridors. Plan for coexistence:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Large mammals:</strong> In bear country, use certified electric fencing around the apiary with proper grounding and maintenance. Keep food-grade buckets and wax indoors to reduce attractants.</li>
        <li><strong>Small mammals &amp; ants:</strong> Clear vegetation under stands, use hive stand legs with ant guards where appropriate, and keep debris away to discourage nesting rodents.</li>
        <li><strong>Human interactions:</strong> Post discrete signs at trail junctions to discourage tampering; avoid high-use recreation zones and respect buffer distances from trails and property lines.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="microclimate">
      <h2>Moisture, ventilation, and microclimate</h2>
      <p>
        Forests trap humidity. Excess moisture is a common failure point:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ventilation:</strong> Use upper entrances or ventilation shims to vent moisture. In wet seasons, consider screened bottom boards while still protecting from drafts.</li>
        <li><strong>Stand height:</strong> 30–40&nbsp;cm above soil reduces splash-back, mould, and skunk predation.</li>
        <li><strong>Covers &amp; insulation:</strong> Tight, weatherproof lids with slight forward tilt shed rain. In cool, wet climates, insulated lids help prevent condensation drip onto winter clusters.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="forage-calendar">
      <h2>Woodland forage: mapping bloom through the year</h2>
      <p>
        Forest forage is patchy—often abundant in spring, variable in summer, and dependent on understory management. Build a simple calendar of local canopy, shrub, and herb-layer bloom:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Early spring:</strong> Willows, maples, alders, hazel, and early understory herbs provide crucial pollen for brood buildup.</li>
        <li><strong>Late spring to early summer:</strong> Fruit trees on edges, blackberry/raspberry thickets, clovers in glades, and wildflowers in powerline cuts.</li>
        <li><strong>Mid to late summer:</strong> Gaps often appear; open areas with native perennials (goldenrods, asters, milkweeds, monardas) sustain colonies.</li>
        <li><strong>Autumn:</strong> Asters and goldenrods dominate; ivy (where present) can provide late nectar in some regions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Work with landowners or land trusts to seed edges and openings, thin dense shade where appropriate, and phase invasive removal with replanting so nectar gaps don’t widen.
      </p>

    <section id="hive-choices">
      <h2>Hive equipment choices for woodland conditions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Durable exteriors:</strong> Use high-quality coatings or rot-resistant materials. In very wet climates, consider breathable finishes that shed water but allow wood to dry.</li>
        <li><strong>Hardware:</strong> Screw fasteners, metal frame rests, and secure lids withstand bumpy access roads and wind gusts under canopy funnels.</li>
        <li><strong>Weight management:</strong> Medium boxes reduce lift strain on uneven terrain. A wagon or pack frame helps on foot-only trails.</li>
        <li><strong>Bear fences &amp; gates:</strong> Integrate fence posts into the site plan before placing hives. Keep vegetation trimmed from wires to maintain charge.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="management">
      <h2>Seasonal management in forests</h2>
      <h3>Spring</h3>
      <p>
        Monitor build-up closely—forest colonies can accelerate rapidly on early tree pollen. Add space as comb is drawn to prevent congestion and swarming. Splits can be timed with peak bloom to balance population and forage.
      </p>
      <h3>Summer</h3>
      <p>
        In mid-summer dearths under heavy canopy, evaluate weights and brood pattern. Reduce entrances on small colonies to limit skunk predation and robbing. Supplemental feeding may be essential for nucs; avoid open feeding that triggers wildlife.
      </p>
      <h3>Autumn</h3>
      <p>
        Heavy syrup (if needed) must be fed early enough to ripen in cool understories. Consolidate brood, remove unusable comb, and ensure adequate ventilation as nights lengthen.
      </p>
      <h3>Winter</h3>
      <p>
        Check fence integrity, secure lids, and ensure top insulation/venting prevent condensation. Emergency feed (fondant) should be placed directly above the cluster with minimal disturbance during warm spells.
      </p>

    <section id="conservation-practices">
      <h2>Conservation practices that help bees and biodiversity</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Edge enrichment:</strong> Plant native, sequentially blooming shrubs (e.g., dogwood, serviceberry, viburnum) and perennials (asters, goldenrods) along tracks and openings.</li>
        <li><strong>Understory restoration:</strong> Thin invasive shrubs, retain flowering natives, and stagger management so bloom continuity persists.</li>
        <li><strong>Deadwood and snags:</strong> Retain where safe—many solitary bees and beneficial insects use dead wood. Place hives away from hazardous snags.</li>
        <li><strong>Water stewardship:</strong> Keep apiaries outside riparian buffers to protect streambanks; provide internal water sources to reduce bank trampling.</li>
        <li><strong>Integrated pest management (IPM):</strong> Emphasise monitoring (sticky boards, alcohol washes), thresholds, and non-chemical tactics before treatments. Choose treatments with minimal impact on non-targets and time them outside peak bloom.</li>
        <li><strong>Chemical minimisation:</strong> Coordinate with foresters to avoid spraying near bloom; request application windows when colonies are confined and temperatures are cool.</li>
        <li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Work with neighbours to create pollinator “stepping stones” across property boundaries—hedgerows, meadows, and field margins.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="partnerships">
      <h2>Working with landowners, foresters, and community groups</h2>
      <p>
        Forest apiaries thrive on collaboration. Draft a simple <em>site stewardship plan</em> that outlines access, parking, biosecurity (clean equipment, disease reporting), pesticide communication, and habitat improvements. Engage local woodland owner associations, land trusts, or parks departments to align beekeeping with invasive control, fuel reduction, and native plant restoration efforts.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="biosecurity">
      <h2>Biosecurity and disease in woodland settings</h2>
      <p>
        High floral diversity usually supports nutrition, but disease pressure still follows bees:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use dedicated gloves and tools per apiary when practical; flame or wash tools between yards.</li>
        <li>Quarantine new queens or equipment; avoid transferring comb from unknown sources.</li>
        <li>Record mite counts and treatments; woodland location doesn’t eliminate Varroa dynamics.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="ethics">
      <h2>Ethics: fitting bees to the woodland, not the other way around</h2>
      <p>
        Honey bees are managed livestock. In high-value conservation areas, limit hive densities to prevent over-competition with native pollinators, and favour habitat creation over colony count as your primary contribution. Keep a light footprint—portable stands, minimal vehicle trips, and careful waste handling—so the apiary could be removed with almost no trace.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="checklist">
      <h2>Quick checklist</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Filtered morning sun, dry footing, reliable water <em>inside</em> the yard.</li>
        <li>Electric fence installed and tested where bears are present.</li>
        <li>Ventilation shim or upper entrance; boxes slightly tilted to shed rain.</li>
        <li>Edge plantings scheduled for sequential bloom; invasive removal staged with replanting.</li>
        <li>Access plan for wet seasons and emergencies; discreet signage.</li>
        <li>IPM calendar integrated with local bloom and dearth periods.</li>
        <li>Stewardship agreement with landowner/manager, including chemical notification.</li>
      </ul>
