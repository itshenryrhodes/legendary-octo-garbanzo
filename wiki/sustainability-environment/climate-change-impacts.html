    <section id="overview">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Beekeeping is tightly coupled to weather and forage timing. Warming temperatures, altered rainfall, and more frequent extremes are reshaping bloom calendars, nectar flows, pest pressures, and overwinter survival. This page summarizes the main pathways by which climate change influences honey bee colonies and outlines practical steps to adapt management while supporting broader pollinator resilience.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="phenology">
      <h2>Phenology shifts: bloom calendars are moving</h2>
      <p>Many plants now flower earlier in spring and, in some regions, finish sooner under heat or drought. When bloom timing no longer aligns with colony development, colonies can miss nectar peaks or face midsummer dearths. Typical effects include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Early spring advance:</strong> Willows, maples, and fruit trees may bloom before colonies build enough foragers to capitalize.</li>
        <li><strong>Compressed flows:</strong> Rapid heat can shorten bloom duration, concentrating nectar in short bursts and leaving longer gaps.</li>
        <li><strong>Shifts in plant mix:</strong> Heat- and drought-tolerant species can replace traditional nectar sources, altering honey profiles.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Beekeeper takeaway:</em> Maintain a site-specific bloom log and compare against prior seasons. Pair notes with <a href="/wiki/data-sensing/hive-weight-monitoring.html">hive weight monitoring</a> to visualize how flow timing is changing year-to-year.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="nectar-water">
      <h2>Nectar production and water stress</h2>
      <p>Nectar secretion depends on plant physiology and soil moisture. Drought reduces nectar volume and sugar concentration; heat waves can cause nectar to dry in flowers. Conversely, prolonged rain can wash out blooms and keep foragers grounded.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Drought:</strong> Lower nectar yields, sparse forage, increased robbing risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Excess rain:</strong> Fewer flight hours, fermented/washed nectar, and chilled brood risk during cold rain events.</li>
        <li><strong>Irrigation patterns:</strong> Urban and agricultural watering can create hyper-local “oases” that shift bee traffic.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Strengthen water availability on-site with shaded, pebble-filled basins (see <a href="/wiki/habitat/water-features-for-bees.html">Providing Water for Bees</a>) and reduce summer stress through <a href="/wiki/sustainability-environment/energy-saving-hive.html">insulation and ventilation</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="heat">
      <h2>Heat, humidity, and colony thermoregulation</h2>
      <p>Bees maintain brood nest temperatures near ~35&nbsp;°C. Extended heat waves increase evaporative cooling effort: more bees fan, more water is collected, and nectar processing slows. In thin-walled equipment or in full sun, comb can soften, honey can slump, and wax moth pressure may increase in hot stacks.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide <strong>midday shade</strong> or filtered light; elevate and orient hives to promote airflow.</li>
        <li>Use <strong>ventilated inner covers</strong> or shim entrances during intense heat, while safeguarding against robbing.</li>
        <li>Prefer <strong>lighter-colored roofs</strong> and reflective covers where overheating is common.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="cold">
      <h2>Winter: not always milder, often more erratic</h2>
      <p>Winters can feature freeze–thaw cycles and late cold snaps after early brood rearing begins. Colonies may consume stores faster and face moisture accumulation from frequent temperature swings.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Improve <strong>top insulation</strong> and upper ventilation to reduce condensation (see <a href="/wiki/operations/winter-prep-checklist.html">Winter prep checklist</a>).</li>
        <li>Reassess <strong>store targets</strong> based on recent winter lengths; add emergency feed when late cold follows early brood expansion.</li>
        <li>Use <strong>wind breaks</strong> and site selection (<a href="/wiki/operations/apiary-layout-basics.html">Apiary layout basics</a>) to stabilize microclimate.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="extremes">
      <h2>Extreme events: storms, wildfire smoke, and floods</h2>
      <p>Storm intensity and frequency can increase, damaging equipment and disrupting flight. Wildfire smoke reduces light and temperature, suppressing foraging and contaminating nectar. Floods can drown colonies and remove forage for months.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Storm hardening:</strong> Strap hives, anchor stands, and ensure stable lids. Avoid low points prone to pooling.</li>
        <li><strong>Smoke events:</strong> Expect reduced flight and weight gain; check ventilation to maintain air quality inside hives.</li>
        <li><strong>Flood planning:</strong> Use higher ground and water-resistant stands; avoid channels and swales.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Integrate weather alerts into your routines and keep a rapid-response kit: straps, extra lids, moving screens, and a plan to relocate at-risk colonies if necessary.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="pests">
      <h2>Pests and diseases under a changing climate</h2>
      <p>Warmer seasons can lengthen brood cycles and increase reproduction rates of <em>Varroa destructor</em> and associated viruses. Some invasive pests expand their range with milder winters. Humid heat favors chalkbrood or small hive beetle slime-outs in weak colonies.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Strengthen monitoring cadence (see <a href="/wiki/colony-health/varroa-monitoring-schedule.html">Varroa monitoring</a>).</li>
        <li>Use a diversified control plan (see <a href="/wiki/sustainability-environment/integrated-pest-management.html">IPM</a> and <a href="/wiki/colony-health/varroa-treatment-honeybeehealth.html">Varroa treatments</a>).</li>
        <li>Manage space and comb to reduce beetle refuges; maintain strong populations during heat.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="nutrition">
      <h2>Nutrition resilience: planting for continuity</h2>
      <p>Climate shifts magnify the cost of forage gaps. Build a resilient forage calendar with overlapping bloom windows and drought-tolerant species. In agricultural landscapes, encourage diversified plantings and reduced pesticide exposure.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Design continuous forage with <a href="/wiki/habitat/year-round-forage-plan.html">Year-Round Forage Planting</a> and <a href="/wiki/habitat/bee-friendly-garden-design.html">bee-friendly gardens</a>.</li>
        <li>At the farm scale, add <a href="/wiki/habitat/flower-strip-design.html">flower strips</a>, <a href="/wiki/habitat/hedgerows-and-bees.html">hedgerows</a>, and <a href="/wiki/habitat/pollinator-corridors.html">pollinator corridors</a>.</li>
        <li>During dearths, consider <a href="/wiki/operations/feeding-sugar-syrup.html">syrup feeding</a> and <a href="/wiki/operations/feeding-pollen-supplements.html">pollen supplements</a> to sustain brood without over-stimulating when flows won’t follow.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="stock">
      <h2>Stock choice and queen strategy</h2>
      <p>Local adaptation and selection for hygienic, frugal, and heat-tolerant traits can improve survival. Explore strains noted for resilience to heat or variable flows, and maintain a plan for timely requeening.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Review <a href="/wiki/sustainability-environment/climate-adaptive-breeds.html">climate-adapted breeds</a> and <a href="/wiki/colony-health/hygienic-breeding.html">hygienic breeding</a> approaches.</li>
        <li>Time <a href="/wiki/operations/queen-introduction.html">requeening</a> to ensure young queens enter winter with strong pheromonal cohesion.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="equipment-adaptations">
      <h2>Equipment and yard adaptations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Thermal performance:</strong> Improve R-value of lids and walls; consider insulated covers or wraps in harsh winters while maintaining ventilation.</li>
        <li><strong>Ventilation &amp; shading:</strong> Add shade cloths for midday, screened bottom boards for airflow, and ensure water is close to reduce foraging distance in heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Comb management:</strong> Replace dark, heavy comb that overheats; avoid tall, top-heavy stacks in storm-prone regions.</li>
        <li><strong>Energy footprint:</strong> Where practical, adopt <a href="/wiki/sustainability-environment/alternative-energy-beekeeping.html">alternative energy</a> for workshops and use <a href="/wiki/sustainability-environment/solar-wax-melter.html">solar wax melters</a> to lower emissions.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="records">
      <h2>Records, sensors, and decision support</h2>
      <p>Good records convert weather variability into actionable insight. Combine field notes with simple sensors to anticipate forage gaps and heating/cooling needs.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/wiki/operations/record-keeping.html">Record-keeping</a> templates that track bloom, inspections, feed, and treatments.</li>
        <li>Use <a href="/wiki/data-sensing/hive-temperature-humidity-sensors.html">hive climate sensors</a> and <a href="/wiki/data-sensing/hive-weight-monitoring.html">scales</a> to detect dearth or overheating early.</li>
        <li>Summarize annual trends to adjust supering, feeding, and queen timelines next season.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="migration">
      <h2>Migratory and stationary beekeeping under variability</h2>
      <p>Migratory operations face shifting bloom windows across regions and increased logistics risk from storms or fire closures. Stationary beekeepers may benefit from a diversified local forage base rather than relying on a single major flow. In both cases, flexible scheduling and contingency yards are increasingly important.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="community">
      <h2>Community action and landscape scale</h2>
      <p>Individual adaptations are stronger when matched by community-scale changes. Partner with growers and councils to reduce pesticide risk, expand forage, and restore habitat heterogeneity. Citizen monitoring can document success and guide investments (see <a href="/wiki/sustainability-environment/pollinator-citizen-science.html">Citizen Science for Pollinators</a> and <a href="/wiki/sustainability-environment/biodiversity-enhancement.html">Biodiversity enhancement</a>).</p>
    </section>

    <section id="checklist">
      <h2>Seasonal adaptation checklist</h2>
      <h3>Early spring</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Compare bloom log against prior years; adjust supering and <a href="/wiki/operations/feeding-sugar-syrup.html">stimulative feeding</a> if flows are early.</li>
        <li>Verify queen status and brood pattern; replace failing queens before main flow.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Summer</h3>
      <ul>
