    <section id="why-biodiversity">
      <h2>Why biodiversity on farms matters</h2>
      <p>Crop yields and apiary success are tightly linked to the diversity of plants, insects, birds, and soil organisms around them. Diverse systems offer continuous bloom for bees, habitat for natural enemies of crop pests, buffers against weather extremes, and better nutrient cycling. For beekeepers, farms with varied flowering resources reduce forage gaps, stabilize nectar flows, and support colony health throughout the season.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pollination:</strong> A wider palette of flowers extends forage windows and improves fruit set and quality.</li>
        <li><strong>Pest regulation:</strong> Hedgerows, cover crops, and flower strips harbor predators and parasitoids that suppress pests.</li>
        <li><strong>Soil function:</strong> More plant species feed a richer soil food web, improving infiltration, aggregation, and drought tolerance.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk reduction:</strong> Mixed habitats reduce the chance that a single pest, pathogen, or weather event collapses productivity.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="design-principles">
      <h2>Design principles for biodiversity</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Layer and connect habitats:</strong> Combine vertical structure (trees, shrubs, forbs, grasses) and connect patches into corridors that bees and beneficials can traverse.</li>
        <li><strong>Stagger bloom across seasons:</strong> Select species that flower in early spring, mid-summer, and late fall so bees rarely face dearth.</li>
        <li><strong>Favor natives where feasible:</strong> Native plants often provide better-quality pollen and nectar and support local beneficial insects.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduce disturbance:</strong> Minimize tillage, avoid blanket herbicide use, and keep refuge areas undisturbed during nesting periods.</li>
        <li><strong>Integrate with operations:</strong> Place biodiversity features where they add wind breaks, erosion control, or equipment buffers to deliver multiple benefits per hectare.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="hedgerows">
      <h2>Hedgerows: living infrastructure</h2>
      <p>Hedgerows are linear plantings of shrubs, small trees, and perennial flowers along field margins. They provide shelter, year-round structure, and step-stone resources for pollinators.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Mix early, mid, and late bloomers; include at least one pollen-rich shrub and one nectar-rich shrub per 20–30 m.</li>
        <li><strong>Spacing &amp; width:</strong> 2–5 m wide strips allow a tree/shrub layer and a forb/grass understory; wider strips yield stronger benefits.</li>
        <li><strong>Edge management:</strong> Mow the outer edge once or twice annually after peak flowering to control weeds while preserving habitat structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Drift buffer:</strong> Hedgerows filter dust and pesticide drift, protecting colonies and flower strips downwind.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For more on linear plantings, see <a href="/wiki/habitat/hedgerows-and-bees.html">Hedgerows as Bee Habitat</a> (planned) and <a href="/wiki/habitat/flower-strip-design.html">Designing Flower Strips</a> (planned).</p>
    </section>

    <section id="flower-strips">
      <h2>Flower strips and beetle banks</h2>
      <p>Flower strips are dense plantings of nectar and pollen plants established within or alongside fields. Beetle banks are raised grassy strips within large fields that harbor ground predators of crop pests.</p>
      <h3>Establishment</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Site prep:</strong> Smother or shallow-cultivate weeds, then drill or broadcast seed into firm soil. Avoid pre-emergent herbicides that inhibit wildflowers.</li>
        <li><strong>Seed mix:</strong> Choose region-appropriate blends with at least 12–20 species and multiple families (Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Lamiaceae, Brassicaceae).</li>
        <li><strong>Strip layout:</strong> Several narrow strips (3–6 m) distributed through large fields provide better coverage than a single block.</li>
        <li><strong>Management:</strong> Year 1 is for weed suppression; mow high before weeds set seed. In later years, mow after bloom pulses and leave some sections uncut as refugia.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Well-designed strips shorten bee flights, raise pollination reliability, and can reduce insecticide needs by supporting predators and parasitoids.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="cover-crops">
      <h2>Cover crops for soil and pollinators</h2>
      <p>Cover crops are a cornerstone of biodiversity management. They add root diversity, protect soil, and—if allowed to bloom—provide forage between cash crops.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Legumes (e.g., clovers, vetches):</strong> Fix nitrogen, offer protein-rich pollen, and boost soil biology.</li>
        <li><strong>Brassicas (e.g., mustard, radish):</strong> Rapid biomass; some bio-fumigation effects; early nectar for bees.</li>
        <li><strong>Grasses (e.g., rye, oats):</strong> Root mass for structure and erosion control; pair with legumes for balanced mixes.</li>
        <li><strong>Phacelia, buckwheat, borage:</strong> Quick, abundant nectar; useful for bridging dearths and attracting beneficials.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Terminate covers with roller-crimpers, mowing, or grazing timed to protect nests and minimize soil disturbance. Where feasible, interseed covers into standing crops to sustain living roots year-round.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="trees-shrubs">
      <h2>Trees, shelterbelts, and woodland edges</h2>
      <p>Trees and tall shrubs supply early-season pollen/nectar and structural diversity. Shelterbelts reduce wind stress, protect soil, and create microclimates that favor beneficial insects.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Early bloomers:</strong> Willows, maples, and fruit trees feed colonies when temperatures are marginal and other flowers scarce.</li>
        <li><strong>Layered edges:</strong> Transition from tall trees to shrubs to herbaceous plants to maximize edge length and niches.</li>
        <li><strong>Water &amp; shade:</strong> Canopy shade reduces heat stress on livestock and workers; roots stabilize stream banks where riparian buffers are planted.</li>
      </ul>

    </section>

    <section id="water-and-soil">
      <h2>Water, soil health, and microhabitats</h2>
      <p>Water sources and soil stewardship underpin resilient biodiversity.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Water features:</strong> Provide shallow, textured drinking sites with landing stones and frequent refills; avoid drowning hazards. See <a href="/wiki/habitat/water-features-for-bees.html">Providing Water for Bees</a> (planned) and <a href="/wiki/sustainability-environment/water-conservation.html">Water Conservation for Pollinators</a> (planned).</li>
        <li><strong>Soil health:</strong> Maintain permanent cover where possible, diversify rotations, and minimize tillage to protect microbial communities and ground-nesting bees. See <a href="/wiki/sustainability-environment/soil-health-for-pollinators.html">Soil Health and Bees</a> (planned).</li>
        <li><strong>Nesting resources:</strong> Leave some bare, well-drained patches and dead wood for solitary bees; mow less frequently to preserve tussocky grass refuges.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="pesticides">
      <h2>Smarter pesticide management</h2>
      <p>Biodiversity and pesticides must be balanced. Adopt practices that protect pollinators and their habitat while maintaining crop protection.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>IPM first:</strong> Monitor pest thresholds and use cultural and biological controls before chemical options (see <a href="/wiki/sustainability-environment/integrated-pest-management.html">Integrated Pest Management (IPM)</a> — planned).</li>
        <li><strong>Choose active ingredients wisely:</strong> Prefer products with low bee toxicity and short residuals; avoid applications when crops or adjacent flora are in bloom.</li>
        <li><strong>Timing &amp; technique:</strong> Apply at dusk/dawn when bees are not foraging; use drift-reducing nozzles; respect buffers and wind limits.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Notify nearby beekeepers ahead of planned sprays; establish predictable windows for treatment to let hives be closed or moved if needed (see <a href="/wiki/community-policy/pesticide-spray-notification.html">Pesticide Application Notification</a> — planned).</li>
      </ul>

    </section>

    <section id="corridors">
      <h2>Connectivity: corridors and field geometry</h2>
      <p>Isolated habitat islands help, but connected habitat networks do more. Align hedgerows, riparian buffers, and flower strips to guide pollinators across the farm and toward neighboring habitats. Even simple choices—like leaving unmown strips along ditches—create safe passage. See <a href="/wiki/habitat/pollinator-corridors.html">Pollinator Corridors and Connectivity</a> (planned).</p>
    </section>

    <section id="operations-integration">
      <h2>Integrating with farm operations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Equipment flow:</strong> Use habitat strips as turn rows or to separate blocks with different harvest dates, so biodiversity features ease logistics rather than obstruct them.</li>
        <li><strong>Livestock systems:</strong> Silvopasture and rotational grazing can add habitat complexity while distributing fertility—protect young plantings with guards and timed access.</li>
        <li><strong>Crop rotations:</strong> Rotate families to disrupt pests and sequence flowering covers between cash crops to maintain forage continuity. See <a href="/wiki/habitat/crop-rotation-and-bees.html">Crop Rotation and Pollinator Health</a> (planned).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="economics">
      <h2>Costs, incentives, and returns</h2>
      <p>Establishing biodiversity features requires upfront investment in seed, plants, and management time. Returns accrue via lower inputs, improved yields/quality, and resilience. Potential incentives include conservation grants, cost-share programs, or certifications that reward pollinator-friendly practices. Track simple metrics—input costs, pest pressure, yield, and pollinator counts—to document benefits over seasons.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="step-by-step">
      <h2>Step-by-step starter plan</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Map current resources:</strong> Note existing trees, ditches, field margins, water, and weedy patches that already host pollinators.</li>
        <li><strong>Pick two quick wins:</strong> (a) establish one 3–5 m flower strip along a field edge; (b) set up shallow water stations near apiaries.</li>
        <li><strong>Add structure:</strong> Plant a mixed hedgerow this dormant season with early and late bloom species.</li>
        <li><strong>Improve soil cover:</strong> Interseed a legume-grass cover mix post-harvest; allow part of it to bloom before termination next year.</li>
        <li><strong>Tune pesticides:</strong> Adopt an IPM scouting log and shift spray timing away from bloom; add drift buffers along habitat edges.</li>
        <li><strong>Connect the dots:</strong> Extend strips to link hedgerow segments and water sources, forming a corridor network.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor &amp; adapt:</strong> Each season, track bloom timing, bee activity, pest levels, and yields; adjust mixes and mowing schedules accordingly.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="bee-integration">
      <h2>Where to place hives in biodiverse farms</h2>
      <p>Position hives downwind from spray zones, near but not inside high-traffic strips, and within 300–800 m of staggered bloom sources. Provide afternoon shade in hot climates and wind protection in open plains. Ensure clean water is closer than neighboring livestock troughs to keep bees on-farm.</p>
