    <section id="why-it-matters">
      <h2>Why climate-adapted stock matters</h2>
      <p>Weather and forage patterns are shifting in many regions. Winters may oscillate between freeze and thaw; summers bring longer heat waves and dearths; spring flows can start earlier and end abruptly. Choosing bee stock with traits that match these conditions can reduce feeding, improve survival, and stabilize yields. This page outlines practical options for selecting and managing climate-adapted honey bee queens and colonies.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="traits">
      <h2>Key traits by climate pressure</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cold tolerance &amp; frugal overwintering:</strong> Tight winter cluster, conservative late-season brood rearing, low consumption of stores, rapid but controlled spring build-up.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat tolerance &amp; drought coping:</strong> Efficient thermoregulation, steady foraging at higher temperatures, lower water demand for cooling, wax that holds under heat, calmness despite dearth.</li>
        <li><strong>Erratic flows &amp; short nectar windows:</strong> Quick spring build, willingness to work in marginal weather, ability to “burst” when nectar appears, then throttle down without swarming.</li>
        <li><strong>Pest/disease resilience:</strong> Hygienic behaviors (e.g., VSH), effective grooming against mites, brood disease resistance—important in any climate but critical where long brood seasons favor pests.</li>
        <li><strong>Resource flexibility:</strong> Capacity to exploit diverse floral sources and shift to alternative nectar or honeydew if primary flows fail.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Climate fit is never just genetics. Yard siting, <a href="/wiki/sustainability-environment/energy-saving-hive.html">insulation and ventilation</a>, and <a href="/wiki/habitat/year-round-forage-plan.html">forage design</a> amplify whatever the bees bring.</p>

    <section id="stocks">
      <h2>Common stocks and where they tend to excel</h2>
      <p>Lines vary by breeder. Treat the summaries below as directional, then evaluate local suppliers and, where possible, queens from survivor stock selected in your conditions.</p>

      <h3>Carniolan (Apis mellifera carnica)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Frugal overwintering, rapid spring build when forage appears, good cold tolerance, gentle temperament.</li>
        <li><strong>Watchouts:</strong> Can swarm if space management lags during sudden spring flows.</li>
        <li><strong>Climate fit:</strong> Regions with long winters and quick, intense spring flows; places with variable shoulder seasons.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Italian (A. m. ligustica)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Productive, steady brood rearing, good in long nectar seasons, widely available.</li>
        <li><strong>Watchouts:</strong> Higher winter consumption; may raise brood late into fall and need extra stores.</li>
        <li><strong>Climate fit:</strong> Mild winters and extended flows; suitable for many temperate areas with adequate winter feed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Caucasian (A. m. caucasica)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Long tongues for deep-corolla forage, good in cool/humid climates, propolizing tendencies can reduce drafts.</li>
        <li><strong>Watchouts:</strong> Heavy propolis can slow inspections; availability is limited in some regions.</li>
        <li><strong>Climate fit:</strong> Cool springs, mountainous regions, damp areas where sealing gaps helps.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Russian (selected stocks)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Noted mite tolerance in some lines, frugal wintering, brood rearing that tracks nectar availability.</li>
        <li><strong>Watchouts:</strong> Can be more defensive in certain crosses; performance varies by breeder.</li>
        <li><strong>Climate fit:</strong> Areas with long winters or irregular flows where throttling brood to resources is an advantage.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Buckfast (composite line)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Bred historically for productivity and disease tolerance; calm temperament in many strains.</li>
        <li><strong>Watchouts:</strong> Genetic consistency depends on breeder discipline; evaluate locally.</li>
        <li><strong>Climate fit:</strong> Broad, depending on strain; often good in maritime climates with variable weather.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Locally adapted survivor stock</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Selected under your exact winters, summers, pests, and flows; often the best long-term match.</li>
        <li><strong>Watchouts:</strong> Availability may be limited; quality varies; documentation of selection criteria matters.</li>
        <li><strong>Climate fit:</strong> Best wherever you are. “Local” that thrives without unusual inputs is a strong baseline.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="matching">
      <h2>Matching stock to your climate signals</h2>
      <p>Use your yard’s last three seasons as the most authoritative dataset. Look at bloom timing, dearth months, maximum and minimum temperatures, and winter length. Then map to traits:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cold, long winters:</strong> Prefer frugal lines (Carniolan, some Russian, proven local survivors). Aim for tight clusters, conservative fall brood, and strong spring burst.</li>
        <li><strong>Hot, dry summers:</strong> Seek heat-tolerant lines that maintain foraging at higher temperatures, resist wax slump, and keep brood viable under heat. Pair with shade, water, and ventilation upgrades.</li>
        <li><strong>Unpredictable flows:</strong> Choose stocks that track nectar availability—able to scale up quickly but throttle down without chronic swarming.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In every case, verify hygienic behavior and mite management compatibility with your <a href="/wiki/sustainability-environment/integrated-pest-management.html">IPM plan</a>.</p>

    <section id="queen-sourcing">
      <h2>Queen sourcing and evaluation</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Prioritize local, data-driven breeders.</strong> Ask how they select: winter survival, mite counts, temperament, honey production, brood pattern.</li>
        <li><strong>Document yard performance.</strong> Keep records of acceptance, brood solidness, temperament, swarm impulse, weight gain (see <a href="/wiki/operations/record-keeping.html">Record-Keeping for Hives</a> and <a href="/wiki/data-sensing/hive-weight-monitoring.html">Hive Weight Monitoring</a>).</li>
        <li><strong>Buy in cohorts.</strong> Requeen a subset of colonies with the same line so you can fairly compare against your current stock under the same weather.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid single-year conclusions.</strong> Climate variability means a stock that shines one season may be average the next; evaluate across at least two seasons.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="management-fit">
      <h2>Management that supports climate adaptation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Right-size the box to the season.</strong> In long winters, reduce excess space and improve top insulation; in heat, increase ventilation and midday shade (see <a href="/wiki/sustainability-environment/energy-saving-hive.html">Insulation and Hive Efficiency</a>).</li>
        <li><strong>Comb strategy.</strong> Replace old, dark comb that overheats; keep straight, worker-biased comb to stabilize brood temperature.</li>
        <li><strong>Flow-aligned supering.</strong> For explosive spring lines (e.g., many Carniolans), super early to prevent congestion; adapt with <a href="/wiki/operations/brood-nest-orientation.html">brood nest orientation</a> tactics to keep the nest open.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutrition buffers.</strong> Plant for continuous forage (see <a href="/wiki/habitat/bee-friendly-garden-design.html">bee-friendly gardens</a>, <a href="/wiki/habitat/flower-strip-design.html">flower strips</a>), and during dearths consider <a href="/wiki/operations/feeding-sugar-syrup.html">syrup</a> and <a href="/wiki/operations/feeding-pollen-supplements.html">pollen supplements</a> without over-stimulating when flows won’t follow.</li>
        <li><strong>Mite vigilance.</strong> Resilient stock still requires monitoring and timely interventions (see <a href="/wiki/colony-health/varroa-monitoring-schedule.html">Varroa monitoring schedule</a> and <a href="/wiki/colony-health/varroa-treatment-honeybeehealth.html">Varroa treatment options</a>).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="risks">
      <h2>Risks, myths, and common pitfalls</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Myth: a “magic” breed solves climate stress.</strong> Genetics help, but poor ventilation, lack of water, or thin stores will still sink colonies.</li>
        <li><strong>Over-generalizing breed labels.</strong> The name (e.g., “Italian”) tells little without the breeder’s selection history. Two “Italian” lines can behave very differently.</li>
        <li><strong>Ignoring local adaptation.</strong> Imported queens from far climates often underperform. Favor lines selected under your region’s pests, flows, and temperatures.</li>
        <li><strong>Chasing traits in isolation.</strong> Heat tolerance without temperament, or frugality without mite resistance, creates new problems.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="breeding">
      <h2>Building your own locally adapted line</h2>
      <p>If you keep several colonies, you can nudge your apiary toward a climate fit by requeening with daughters from top performers.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Identify candidates:</strong> Winter survival with modest feed, low mite loads, calmness, strong spring build timed to local flow.</li>
        <li><strong>Use simple queen raising:</strong> Starter/finisher or walk-away splits (see <a href="/wiki/operations/queen-cell-raising.html">Raising Queen Cells</a> and <a href="/wiki/operations/queen-introduction.html">Introducing a New Queen</a>).</li>
        <li><strong>Record and cull:</strong> Replace poor performers quickly to keep the selection pressure high.</li>
        <li><strong>Diversity matters:</strong> Avoid bottlenecks; bring in outside queens with proven local data to refresh genetics.</li>
      </ol>
