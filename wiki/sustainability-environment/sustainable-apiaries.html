    <section id="why">
      <h2>Why an eco-friendly apiary?</h2>
      <p>
        Healthy colonies rely on healthy landscapes. An eco-friendly apiary aims to minimize resource use and emissions while improving forage, water quality, and resilience around the hives. The approach is practical: switch to durable materials, cut single-use plastics, insulate for winter efficiency, streamline transport, and manage waste as a closed loop. Small choices across a season compound into measurable environmental benefits.

    <section id="principles">
      <h2>Core principles</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bee health first:</strong> Every “green” change must maintain or improve colony outcomes. Where trade-offs exist, choose the option that protects bees.</li>
        <li><strong>Source less, use longer:</strong> Favor durable, repairable equipment; standardize parts to extend life; design for end-of-life recycling.</li>
        <li><strong>Electrify &amp; insulate:</strong> Reduce fossil fuel use and thermal losses at the hive and in the honey house.</li>
        <li><strong>Close the loop:</strong> Capture wax, water, heat, and packaging into reuse cycles. Compost organic residues.</li>
        <li><strong>Measure &amp; improve:</strong> Track a few metrics consistently and act on what the data shows.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="materials">
      <h2>Materials &amp; procurement</h2>
      <p>
        Hive equipment sees weather, propolis, and prying. Eco-friendly does not mean fragile—choose materials that last and can be repaired.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Timber:</strong> Responsibly sourced softwoods or hardwoods, finger-jointed where appropriate to reduce waste. Seal edges and end grain; repaint as maintenance instead of replacing.</li>
        <li><strong>Insulation:</strong> Fit removable, weather-resistant insulation panels or sleeves to cut winter heat loss and reduce moisture issues. See <a href="/wiki/sustainability-environment/energy-saving-hive.html">Insulation &amp; hive efficiency</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Frames &amp; foundation:</strong> Where practical, avoid single-use plastic foundation. Use wired wax foundation or starter strips and adopt a comb rotation plan. See <a href="/wiki/operations/comb-replacement.html">Replacing old comb</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Fasteners &amp; hardware:</strong> Stainless or coated to extend service life; standardize sizes across the operation to simplify repairs.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduce plastics:</strong> Audit plastic items and identify substitutes or reusable designs. See <a href="/wiki/sustainability-environment/reduce-plastic-use.html">Reducing plastic use in beekeeping</a>.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="energy">
      <h2>Energy: hives, tools, and the honey house</h2>
      <p>
        Energy use peaks during extraction and processing. Focus on insulation, heat recovery, and electrification.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Solar wax melter:</strong> Turn cappings and burr comb into clean wax using sunlight; reserve electric melters for rainy weeks. See <a href="/wiki/sustainability-environment/solar-wax-melter.html">Using a solar wax melter</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Efficient extraction line:</strong> Right-size motors, insulate hot water lines, and use thermostatic controls on decrystallization tanks.</li>
        <li><strong>Lighting &amp; fans:</strong> LED fixtures and high-efficiency ventilation improve safety and reduce load during summer harvests.</li>
        <li><strong>Space heating/cooling:</strong> Seal drafts, add door sweeps, and insulate the honey room envelope. Consider heat-pump water heaters to supply washdown water efficiently.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        At the hive, insulation and tight lids reduce winter fuel required for emergency trips and cut colony stress. Cross-link with <a href="/wiki/sustainability-environment/carbon-footprint-honey.html">Carbon footprint of beekeeping</a> for a system view.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="water-waste">
      <h2>Water &amp; waste</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Conserve &amp; capture:</strong> Install rain barrels and use low-flow nozzles for washdown. Direct roof runoff into vegetation strips. See <a href="/wiki/sustainability-environment/water-conservation.html">Water conservation for pollinators</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Bee-safe water points:</strong> Provide shallow, textured basins with floats or pebbles to prevent drowning and reduce visits to risky sources.</li>
        <li><strong>Waste streams:</strong> Separate cappings wax, propolis scrapings, and organic residue for rendering or composting. Label bins clearly in the honey house.</li>
        <li><strong>Detergents &amp; sanitizers:</strong> Use biodegradable products where food-safe and effective; standardize dilution ratios to avoid overuse.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="transport">
      <h2>Transport &amp; logistics</h2>
      <p>
        Vehicle fuel is often a large share of an apiary’s footprint. Route smarter and carry more in fewer trips.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Routing:</strong> Cluster yards and plan a fixed circuit; combine inspections, feeding, and pickups into single visits.</li>
        <li><strong>On-site handling:</strong> Use dollies or a small hive lifter to cut idling time and reduce injury risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Electrify where feasible:</strong> Battery tools (saws, blowers, drills) and, when possible, hybrid or EV service vehicles for local yards.</li>
        <li><strong>Load discipline:</strong> Keep standardized totes and checklists so nothing requires an extra trip. See <a href="/wiki/operations/first-inspection-checklist.html">First inspection checklist</a>.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="habitat">
      <h2>Habitat integration</h2>
      <p>
        An eco-friendly apiary improves the landscape it occupies. Plant for continuous bloom, structure windbreaks, and protect water.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Forage planning:</strong> Add hedgerows, clover understories, and pollen-rich perennials. See <a href="/wiki/sustainability-environment/biodiversity-enhancement.html">Enhancing biodiversity in farms</a> and <a href="/wiki/habitat/flower-strip-design.html">Designing flower strips</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Corridors &amp; connectivity:</strong> Link plantings to nearby habitats to extend flight paths. Coordinate with neighbors and local associations.</li>
        <li><strong>Shade &amp; wind:</strong> Use living windbreaks and orient hives with clear flight lines for summer cooling and winter shelter. See <a href="/wiki/operations/apiary-layout-basics.html">Apiary layout basics</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Consider how honey bee stocking density interacts with local native pollinators. Balance hive numbers with forage and share monitoring results via <a href="/wiki/sustainability-environment/pollinator-citizen-science.html">citizen science</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="chemicals">
      <h2>Chemical footprint &amp; IPM</h2>
      <p>
        Eco-friendly does not mean chemical-free; it means using the least-harmful effective methods at the right time, guided by data. Adopt <a href="/wiki/sustainability-environment/integrated-pest-management.html">Integrated Pest Management (IPM)</a> and rely on monitoring thresholds from <a href="/wiki/colony-health/varroa-monitoring-schedule.html">Varroa monitoring</a> to time treatments. Rotate modes of action, ventilate well, and document every application. Store chemicals in secondary containment and dispose of residues per label guidance.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="packaging">
      <h2>Packaging, processing &amp; reuse</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Reusable food-grade pails:</strong> Move honey in durable, sealable pails; clean and recirculate rather than buying new.</li>
        <li><strong>Glass &amp; recycled content:</strong> Prefer glass jars with recycled content; offer deposit returns at markets. See <a href="/wiki/sustainability-environment/sustainable-honey-packaging.html">Eco-friendly honey packaging</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Wax lifecycle:</strong> Render cappings and old comb; trade or sell cleaned wax for candles or foundation. See <a href="/wiki/operations/wax-rendering.html">Wax rendering &amp; storage</a> and <a href="/wiki/sustainability-environment/recycling-hive-materials.html">Recycling hive materials</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Labels &amp; inks:</strong> Use minimal labels, water-based inks, and recyclable papers; print batch codes for traceability.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="governance">
      <h2>Governance, transparency &amp; community</h2>
      <p>
        Publish a short sustainability policy on your website. Share how you reduce plastics, energy, and transport miles. Report progress annually with simple visuals. Join local clubs to exchange seed mixes, wax processing tips, or share specialty tools such as solar melters. See <a href="/wiki/community-policy/beekeeping-associations.html">Beekeeping associations &amp; clubs</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="metrics">
      <h2>Metrics that matter</h2>
      <p>Track a handful of indicators each season and compare year to year:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Transport:</strong> Liters (or gallons) of fuel per hive visit or per 100 kg of honey extracted.</li>
        <li><strong>Energy:</strong> kWh used for extraction and decrystallization per 100 kg of honey.</li>
        <li><strong>Materials:</strong> Percentage of reusable packaging returned; kg of plastic avoided or recycled.</li>
        <li><strong>Waste:</strong> Wax recovered (kg), cappings moisture captured (L), composted residues (kg).</li>
        <li><strong>Habitat:</strong> Linear meters of hedgerow/flower strip established; months of continuous bloom achieved.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you use sensors or apps, log these in your data system. See <a href="/wiki/data-sensing/data-management-practices.html">Data management for beekeepers</a>.
