    <section id="why-it-matters">
      <h2>Why bees matter to sustainable farming</h2>
      <p>Pollinators convert floral resources into fruit and seed. In agriculture, that translates into improved <em>yield</em> (more fruit per plant), <em>quality</em> (shape, size, reduced culls), and <em>stability</em> (more consistent set across blocks and seasons). Honey bees (<em>Apis mellifera</em>) are the most widely managed pollinator because they can be transported, split, and provisioned at scale. Wild pollinators—bumble bees, solitary bees, butterflies, flies—often complement honey bees, visiting at different times or under cooler, windier conditions. Sustainable farms design for both, since diversified pollinator communities are more resilient to weather, pesticides, and disease shocks.</p>

    <section id="crops-benefiting">
      <h2>Crops that benefit from bee pollination</h2>
      <p>Bee pollination is essential or highly beneficial for many fruits, nuts, oilseeds, and vegetables. Typical examples include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tree fruits &amp; nuts:</strong> apples, pears, cherries, almonds, avocados.</li>
        <li><strong>Berries:</strong> blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, strawberries (improved shape and marketability).</li>
        <li><strong>Vine crops:</strong> cucurbits such as pumpkins, squash, cucumbers, melons.</li>
        <li><strong>Oilseeds &amp; seeds:</strong> canola/rapeseed, sunflower, clover and alfalfa seed (leafcutter bees are also used).</li>
        <li><strong>Vegetables &amp; specialty:</strong> seed crops for brassicas and carrots, some herbs and spices.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Even partially self-fertile crops see measurable gains when bee visitation increases, because cross-pollen improves fruit set and uniformity.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="stocking-rates">
      <h2>Stocking rates and timing</h2>
      <p>“How many hives?” depends on crop, bloom density, field size, weather, competing forage, and colony strength. As general starting points used across regions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Apples, cherries:</strong> ~1–2 strong colonies per acre (2.5–5 per hectare).</li>
        <li><strong>Blueberries:</strong> ~2–5 per acre (5–12 per hectare), often on the higher end for large plantings and cool weather.</li>
        <li><strong>Almonds:</strong> ~2 per acre is common, with contract language specifying 8+ frames of brood/coverage.</li>
        <li><strong>Cucurbits:</strong> ~1–2 per acre depending on variety and field configuration.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Place colonies when 5–10% of flowers are open; this ensures bees “learn” the crop and are present through peak bloom. Avoid arriving too early if alternate forage will distract foragers, but not so late that early blossoms miss coverage. Strong colonies with good temperament and disease control outperform weak ones even at lower hive counts—strength matters as much as numbers. See <a href="/wiki/operations/first-inspection-checklist.html">First inspection checklist</a> and <a href="/wiki/colony-health/varroa-monitoring-schedule.html">Varroa monitoring schedule</a> for keeping colonies field-ready.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="placement">
      <h2>Apiary placement for field efficiency</h2>
      <p>Distribute colonies around fields to reduce travel time and concentrate foraging where fruit set is most limiting. Good practices include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clustered sets</strong> of 8–24 hives with multiple drops per large block rather than one large stack at the corner.</li>
        <li><strong>Sun, shelter, and access:</strong> morning sun to start flight early; windbreaks or hedgerows to reduce drift; vehicle access that won’t compact wet soils.</li>
        <li><strong>Water within 10–20 m:</strong> keep bees off irrigation risers and neighboring water features. See <a href="/wiki/colony-health/ventilation-and-mold.html">Hive ventilation and moisture</a> (planned) and <a href="/wiki/habitat/water-features-for-bees.html">Providing Water for Bees</a> (planned).</li>
        <li><strong>Entrance orientation</strong> away from roads and work crews. See <a href="/wiki/operations/apiary-layout-basics.html">Apiary layout basics</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Rotate locations annually if feasible to prevent chronic drift to the same corners and to vary exposure to dust and traffic.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="habitat">
      <h2>On-farm habitat: pollination insurance</h2>
      <p>Monocultures create a boom-and-bust pattern for pollinators: abundant bloom for a short window followed by dearth. Sustainable farms smooth that curve by adding habitat elements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Flower strips &amp; field margins:</strong> multi-species mixes that bloom before and after the crop. See <a href="/wiki/habitat/flower-strip-design.html">Designing Flower Strips</a> (planned).</li>
        <li><strong>Hedgerows &amp; tree lines:</strong> layered shrubs and trees provide forage, wind protection, and nesting. See <a href="/wiki/habitat/hedgerows-and-bees.html">Hedgerows as Bee Habitat</a> (planned).</li>
        <li><strong>Cover crops:</strong> clovers, vetch, phacelia in alleyways or post-harvest windows.</li>
        <li><strong>Water features:</strong> shallow, clean sources with landing surfaces.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced till &amp; pesticide-safe practices:</strong> protect ground-nesting and cavity-nesting bees.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Habitat raises wild pollinator abundance and complements honey bee activity, improving set in difficult corners and during cool or windy periods. For garden-scale guidance, see <a href="/wiki/habitat/planting-for-pollinators.html">Planting for pollinators</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="ipm">
      <h2>IPM and pesticide risk reduction</h2>
      <p>Pollinator-safe pest management is central to sustainable agriculture. Adopt the following hierarchy:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Prevention:</strong> resistant varieties, sanitation, crop rotation, and habitat for natural enemies.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitoring and thresholds:</strong> act only when pests exceed economic thresholds; avoid calendar sprays.</li>
        <li><strong>Selective controls:</strong> target pests with low bee toxicity; prefer night or pre-dawn applications outside bee foraging hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Formulation &amp; application:</strong> avoid microencapsulated products that resemble pollen; control drift and dust; mow flowering weeds before spraying.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> notify beekeepers ahead of sprays, especially during bloom. See <a href="/wiki/sustainability-environment/integrated-pest-management.html">Integrated Pest Management</a> (planned) and <a href="/wiki/community-policy/pesticide-spray-notification.html">Pesticide Application Notification</a> (planned).</li>
      </ol>
      <p>On dust-prone crops (e.g., during planting treated seed), use deflectors and dust-reducing lubricants and keep bees away until residues settle. Provide clean water so bees are less tempted by puddles in treated fields.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="contracts">
      <h2>Pollination contracts: clarity prevents conflict</h2>
      <p>Written agreements align expectations between growers and beekeepers. Typical clauses cover:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hive count and strength:</strong> minimum frames of bees/brood, replacement policy if colonies are weak.</li>
        <li><strong>Placement &amp; access:</strong> drop points, vehicular access, and security against theft or vandalism.</li>
        <li><strong>Timing:</strong> delivery and pickup windows relative to percent bloom.</li>
        <li><strong>Pesticide practices:</strong> notification windows, no-spray periods during full bloom, and compensation if misuse causes losses.</li>
        <li><strong>Payment schedule:</strong> per-hive fee, inspection rights, and documentation (photos, logs, beekeeper inspection notes).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Inspection logs and simple metrics help both parties judge success (see below). For record templates, see <a href="/wiki/operations/record-keeping.html">Record-Keeping for Hives</a> (planned).</p>
    </section>

    <section id="metrics">
      <h2>Measuring pollination success</h2>
      <p>Yield is the ultimate metric, but you can measure earlier to adjust practices season-to-season:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Visitation rate:</strong> counts of bee visits per minute per 100 flowers at several points across a block.</li>
        <li><strong>Pollen deposition:</strong> stigma pollen counts in sample flowers (research/consultant level but insightful).</li>
        <li><strong>Fruit set &amp; shape:</strong> percent fruit set and cull rates due to poor pollination (misshapen berries, crooks in cucurbits).</li>
        <li><strong>Hive weight curves:</strong> increased nectar intake during bloom shows alignment of foraging with crop. See <a href="/wiki/data-sensing/hive-weight-monitoring.html">Hive Weight Monitoring</a> (planned).</li>
        <li><strong>Bloom overlap mapping:</strong> compare hive activity windows to actual bloom progression across microclimates; <a href="/wiki/data-sensing/apiary-weather-stations.html">Apiary Weather Stations</a> (planned) help.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Simple field notes—date, time, temperature, wind, sun, and a 5-minute flower count—are often sufficient and highly actionable.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="colony-readiness">
      <h2>Keeping colonies field-ready</h2>
      <p>Farms depending on pollination should encourage or contract for good colony management. Core elements include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Health monitoring:</strong> routine mite checks with threshold-based treatment; see <a href="/wiki/colony-health/varroa-monitoring-schedule.html">Varroa monitoring schedule</a> and <a href="/wiki/colony-health/hygienic-behaviour-testing.html">Hygienic behaviour testing</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Swarm control:</strong> provide space and use proven methods to avoid pre-bloom swarms; see <a href="/wiki/operations/swarm-signs-and-prevention.html">Swarm signs &amp; prevention</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutrition:</strong> ensure stores before transport; supplement during dearth; see <a href="/wiki/operations/feeding-basics.html">Feeding basics</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Queen quality:</strong> watch for failing queens and replace promptly; see <a href="/wiki/colony-health/queen-replacement-signs.html">Queen replacement signs</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Equipment readiness:</strong> sound boxes, tight lids, secure pallets, and clean <a href="/wiki/foundations/hive-tool-basics.html">hive tools</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Healthy, well-managed colonies reduce drift, defend less aggressively, and work the crop more uniformly—key to sustainable outcomes.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="designing-the-farm">
      <h2>Farm design for bees and people</h2>
      <p>Sustainability balances productivity, ecosystem health, and worker/community safety. Design choices that help:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Traffic planning:</strong> place drops away from harvest routes and high-use gates; orient entrances into fields or hedges, not roads.</li>
        <li><strong>Buffer zones:</strong> use hedges or tall cover along playgrounds, trails, or residences bordering fields. See <a href="/wiki/community-policy/apiary-placement-ordinance.html">Apiary Placement Guidelines</a> (planned) and <a href="/wiki/community-policy/zoning-and-urban-laws.html">Beekeeping and Zoning Laws</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Corridors:</strong> connect habitat patches across the farm and with neighbors; see <a href="/wiki/habitat/pollinator-corridors.html">Pollinator Corridors and Connectivity</a> (planned).</li>
        <li><strong>Water stewardship:</strong> harvest rain, reduce runoff, and keep open water clean; see <a href="/wiki/sustainability-environment/water-conservation.html">Water Conservation for Pollinators</a> (planned).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="climate">
      <h2>Climate variability and adaptive strategies</h2>
      <p>Warmer winters, erratic springs, and heat spikes shift bloom timing and shorten nectar windows. Adaptive steps include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Phenology tracking:</strong> log first bloom, full bloom, and bee arrival across blocks to inform next season’s hive dates.</li>
        <li><strong>Diverse forage:</strong> off-crop habitat stabilizes colonies when bloom is early or truncated. See <a href="/wiki/sustainability-environment/biodiversity-enhancement.html">Enhancing Biodiversity in Farms</a> (planned).</li>
        <li><strong>Heat and water management:</strong> shade structures, windbreaks, and reliable water reduce stress during hot spells.</li>
        <li><strong>Resilient genetics &amp; management:</strong> select stock suited to local seasons; split/requeen to keep colonies at ideal strength before key crops.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Robust monitoring—weight, temperature, and weather—helps synchronize bee strength with crop bloom in a changing climate. See <a href="/wiki/data-sensing/hive-weight-monitoring.html">Hive Weight Monitoring</a> (planned) and <a href="/wiki/data-sensing/apiary-weather-stations.html">Apiary Weather Stations</a> (planned).</p>
    </section>

    <section id="coexistence">
      <h2>Coexisting with native pollinators</h2>
      <p>Managed honey bees and native bees can compete when floral resources are scarce. Farms can reduce competition and support biodiversity by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Staggering floral resources</strong> via habitat mixes that bloom outside crop windows.</li>
        <li><strong>Right-sizing hive counts</strong> to the crop and landscape; avoid importing excess hives during drought or dearth.</li>
        <li><strong>Providing nesting sites</strong> (bare soil patches, bee hotels) away from hive flight paths.</li>
        <li><strong>Minimizing pesticide exposure</strong> for all pollinators through IPM and careful timing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These steps align farm outcomes (yield, quality) with regional conservation goals.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="step-by-step">
      <h2>Step-by-step: setting up pollination on a sustainable farm</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Map bloom and habitat:</strong> identify early, peak, and late resources; locate gaps to fill with cover crops or strips.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose partners:</strong> select reputable beekeepers with health records and clear communication.</li>
        <li><strong>Write the contract:</strong> include strength standards, pesticide communication, access, and payment milestones.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare sites:</strong> level pads, windbreaks, and water; mark drop points on a farm map for night delivery.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor during bloom:</strong> track visitation and set; adjust hive spacing or add a small number of colonies if needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Debrief post-harvest:</strong> compare blocks, yields, and culls; record lessons for next season.</li>
      </ol>
