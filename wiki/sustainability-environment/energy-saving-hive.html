    <section id="why">
      <h2>Why insulation matters</h2>
      <p>
        Honey bees are endothermic as a <em>colony</em>. They generate heat via the winter cluster and dissipate it via ventilation and fanning. Poorly insulated hives leak heat, pushing bees to burn more honey to hold brood-area temperatures near 34–35&nbsp;°C and core-cluster temperatures around 20–25&nbsp;°C when broodless. Excess heat loss also drives condensation that can chill bees and wet comb. Good insulation improves <strong>energy efficiency</strong>: the cluster maintains temperature with less effort, stores last longer, and moisture risks drop. In hot climates, insulation also <strong>reduces heat gain</strong>, keeping combs straighter and brood areas less stressed.

    <section id="physics">
      <h2>Basics of hive heat transfer</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Conduction:</strong> Heat moving through solid walls and lids. Counter with materials that have higher R-values (lower U-values).</li>
        <li><strong>Convection:</strong> Air exchange at joints, entrances, and covers. Counter with draft control and good seals (without choking fresh air).</li>
        <li><strong>Radiation:</strong> Solar gain and radiant loss from surfaces. Counter with reflective lids, light colours, and shade management.</li>
        <li><strong>Moisture:</strong> Warm, moist air rises; if it meets a cold surface, condensation forms. Insulated tops and <em>controlled</em> ventilation prevent “rain” in the hive.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A roof with decent insulation often yields the largest benefit, followed by wall insulation and wind shielding. Bottoms matter for drafts and summer heat exchange, but overwinter heat loss is typically dominated by the lid and upper seams.
      </p>

    <section id="materials">
      <h2>Common insulation materials</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rigid foam (EPS/XPS/PIR):</strong> Lightweight, high R-value per thickness, easy to cut. Protect from sunlight and pecking; encase in wood, tape edges, or use factory poly boxes.</li>
        <li><strong>Wood fiber &amp; cork:</strong> Renewable, good acoustic and thermal performance, lower synthetics footprint; heavier and costlier than foam at equivalent R.</li>
        <li><strong>Wool/fleece quilts:</strong> Used in “quilt boxes” above the inner cover. They buffer humidity and add modest R-value while keeping the top warm and dry.</li>
        <li><strong>Reflective foils:</strong> Useful beneath lids to reduce radiant gain/loss; only work when facing an air gap.</li>
        <li><strong>Poly hives:</strong> Factory-molded EPS boxes with integrated insulation (common in colder regions). Durable if protected; watch for chewing and strap securely.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Avoid materials that trap liquid water against wood (unvented plastic wraps without a warm top), or anything that sheds fibres or dust into the hive.

    <section id="climate-choice">
      <h2>Choosing an insulation strategy by climate</h2>
      <h3>Cold temperate</h3>
      <p>
        Prioritize a <strong>warm roof</strong> (R-10–R-20 equivalent), insulated side walls (R-5+), reduced convective drafts, and a moisture-buffering quilt. Narrow the entrance but don’t seal it: fresh air keeps CO<sub>2</sub> reasonable and allows moisture to escape.
      </p>
      <h3>Maritime/mild</h3>
      <p>
        Focus on <strong>moisture control</strong> and wind shielding. A quilt or insulated crown board is often enough; full wraps can be optional if colonies are strong and sheltered.
      </p>
      <h3>Hot/arid or hot/humid</h3>
      <p>
        Insulation still helps—by <strong>blocking midday heat</strong>. Use light-coloured lids, reflective covers with an air gap, and afternoon shade. Ensure ample ventilation so the colony can evaporatively cool without persistent humidity spikes.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="moisture">
      <h2>Moisture and ventilation</h2>
      <p>
        Bees can tolerate cold better than cold <em>and wet</em>. The goal is a <strong>warm, dry top</strong> with <strong>controlled ventilation</strong>. Practical pattern:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Install an insulated inner cover or a quilt box (5–10&nbsp;cm deep) filled with wood shavings, hemp, or wool felt inside a breathable fabric.</li>
        <li>Keep the <strong>top exit tiny or none</strong> if the top is warm; use a modest lower entrance (6–12&nbsp;mm tall) for air exchange without a direct chimney effect.</li>
        <li>Seal obvious cracks around supers with weather-resistant tape or proper joinery to prevent gusty crossflow.</li>
        <li>Monitor with a small temp/RH sensor above the brood nest; aim for stable RH and minimal condensation.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="install">
      <h2>Install patterns that work</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Lid insulation:</strong> Add a rigid-foam board cut to the inner cover footprint, 25–50&nbsp;mm thick. Keep a thin air gap under reflective foil if used.</li>
        <li><strong>Wall wraps or sleeves:</strong> Fit breathable, insulated sleeves or foam panels within a wooden shell. Leave the entrance clear; avoid blocking handholds and straps.</li>
        <li><strong>Quilt box:</strong> A 50–90&nbsp;mm rim box with breathable fill above the inner cover. Replace or dry the fill if it becomes damp.</li>
        <li><strong>Wind shielding:</strong> Use natural screens (hedges) or removable panels to break prevailing winds without causing summer heat build-up.</li>
        <li><strong>Strapping &amp; rodent guards:</strong> Straps prevent lids from lifting; guards deter nesting in warm insulation cavities.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="summer">
      <h2>Summer efficiency and comb stability</h2>
      <p>
        Insulation isn’t only for winter. In hot periods, a warm roof plus ventilation can keep brood nest temperatures steadier, reduce melted cappings, and cut fanning effort. Provide:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Afternoon shade or a reflective cover board with a small air gap beneath.</li>
        <li>Upper <em>or</em> lower ventilation, but avoid straight-through drafts across the brood nest.</li>
        <li>Room to evaporate: add supers early during flows to reduce humidity and clustering heat.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>How to measure “efficiency”</h2>
      <p>
        Track results to confirm the benefit for your climate and bee stocks:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stores burn rate:</strong> With hive scales, calculate kg/week loss in winter. Insulated setups often show a smaller, smoother slope.</li>
        <li><strong>Internal climate:</strong> Place one sensor above the brood nest and another beneath the lid. Look for fewer sharp drops after cold fronts.</li>
        <li><strong>Condensation events:</strong> Log visible wetness or drips on the inner cover; aim for near-zero.</li>
        <li><strong>Spring build-up:</strong> Record first brood expansion date and brood area. Consistency across yards suggests thermal stability pays off.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="mistakes">
      <h2>Common mistakes to avoid</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sealing everything:</strong> Airtight hives trap moisture and odors. Always keep a modest entrance.</li>
        <li><strong>Cold lid, warm walls:</strong> The top becomes a condensing plate. Insulate the lid first.</li>
        <li><strong>Wet wraps:</strong> Non-breathable wraps that collect water can rot wood. Use breathable covers or ensure a dry, warm top.</li>
        <li><strong>Ignoring wind:</strong> Even well-insulated hives suffer if wind blasts through seams. Shield the site.</li>
        <li><strong>Unprotected foam:</strong> UV and birds degrade exposed foam. Encapsulate or use factory poly boxes.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="faq">
      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <p><strong>Will insulation cause excessive moisture?</strong> Not if the lid is warm and you maintain a modest entrance. Most moisture issues come from a cold top, not from insulation itself.</p>
      <p><strong>Do screened bottom boards (SBB) fight insulation?</strong> SBBs exhaust drafts downward. In very cold spells, insert the tray to cut convection; in mild climates, leaving them partly open can be fine if the top is insulated.</p>
      <p><strong>How thick is “enough”?</strong> As a practical rule: lid R-10+ and side R-5+ in cold regions; half those values in mild areas. Poly hives typically meet or exceed these targets out of the box.</p>
      <p><strong>Won’t strong insulation make spring swarming worse?</strong> Not directly. Crowding and young queens drive swarming more than wall R-value. Manage space and young brood rearing as usual.</p>

    <section id="checklist">
      <h2>Quick checklist</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Warm, insulated lid (priority #1).</li>
        <li>Optional insulated walls; keep joints tight and wind-shielded.</li>
        <li>Quilt box or moisture buffer above the inner cover.</li>
        <li>Consistent but modest entrance for fresh air.</li>
        <li>Light coloured, reflective exterior in hot sun; afternoon shade if possible.</li>
        <li>Monitor stores and internal RH/temperature to verify gains.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="sustainability">
      <h2>Sustainability angle</h2>
      <p>
        Efficient hives consume fewer emergency feeds and reduce transport for mid-winter interventions. Renewable materials (cork, wood fiber, wool) and long-lived poly boxes, when protected and repaired, can minimize waste over a hive’s lifetime. Pair insulation upgrades with other eco-steps: reusing frames where safe, solar wax processing, and habitat planting to smooth forage gaps.
