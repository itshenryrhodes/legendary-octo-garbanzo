    <section id="why-it-matters">
      <h2>Why a bee-friendly garden?</h2>
      <p>Honey bees and wild pollinators thrive where flowers provide abundant nectar and pollen over a long season, water is safe and accessible, nesting and shelter are available, and pesticides are minimized. A small garden can make a meaningful difference when it supplies continuous bloom and safe forage within flight range of colonies.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="principles">
      <h2>Design principles</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Continuous bloom:</strong> Aim for overlapping flowers from early spring through late autumn.</li>
        <li><strong>Diversity and density:</strong> Plant clusters (drifts) of 3–7+ plants per species so bees can forage efficiently.</li>
        <li><strong>Layered structure:</strong> Combine trees, shrubs, perennials, and groundcovers to boost nectar and shelter.</li>
        <li><strong>Right plant, right place:</strong> Choose plants suited to your light, soil, and climate to reduce inputs.</li>
        <li><strong>Low-risk care:</strong> Avoid systemic insecticides, time any necessary applications outside bloom, and prefer mechanical/biological controls.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="site-assessment">
      <h2>Site assessment (15 minutes)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Most nectar plants prefer 6–8 hours of sun. Map morning vs. afternoon sun to place heat-tolerant species accordingly.</li>
        <li><strong>Soil &amp; drainage:</strong> Observe where water pools or drains quickly. Amend compacted zones with compost; use raised beds where drainage is poor.</li>
        <li><strong>Wind &amp; shelter:</strong> Note prevailing winds; add hedging/shrubs to reduce turbulence along flight paths.</li>
        <li><strong>Existing assets:</strong> Mature trees and “weeds” (clover, dandelion) can already support bees—manage, don’t necessarily remove.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="layering">
      <h2>Build a layered plant community</h2>
      <p>Layering increases floral volume, extends bloom, and offers shelter:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Canopy &amp; sub-canopy:</strong> Flowering trees (e.g., fruit trees, maples, willows) provide early-season forage and shade for understory plants.</li>
        <li><strong>Shrub layer:</strong> Flowering shrubs offer mid-season nectar and nesting cover.</li>
        <li><strong>Perennial/herb layer:</strong> Long-blooming perennials and herbs diversify nectar/pollen profiles.</li>
        <li><strong>Groundcover layer:</strong> Low plants and self-seeders fill gaps and suppress weeds without mulch overuse.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="continuous-bloom">
      <h2>Plan for continuous bloom</h2>
      <p>Use a simple seasonal grid to ensure overlap. Choose locally adapted species with staggered flowering windows.</p>
      <h3>Early season (colony buildup)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Willows and maples (tree pollen/nectar when few others bloom)</li>
        <li>Early bulbs and spring perennials; cool-season herbs starting to wake</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Mid season (peak growth and swarming)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Flowering shrubs and a wide spectrum of perennials and herbs</li>
        <li>White clover or similar groundcovers to backfill bare soil</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Late season (winter-bee cohort)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Late-blooming perennials and annuals to fuel fat-body development</li>
        <li>Flowering trees/shrubs with late nectar, plus “shoulder-season” herbs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Cluster each species in drifts to reduce foraging energy costs and to make the display legible to pollinators.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="water">
      <h2>Water: safe, shallow, reliable</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Shallow sources:</strong> Provide trays with pebbles/cork so bees can land safely. Refill frequently in hot weather.</li>
        <li><strong>Placement:</strong> Set water upwind of hives to draw bees across the garden rather than into neighboring spaces.</li>
        <li><strong>Cleanliness:</strong> Change water often; avoid algicides—use a quick brush and rinse.</li>
      </ul>

    </section>

    <section id="nesting-shelter">
      <h2>Nesting and shelter</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Undisturbed ground:</strong> Leave some bare, well-drained soil patches for ground-nesting solitary bees.</li>
        <li><strong>Dead wood &amp; stems:</strong> Retain snag branches or bundle hollow stems for cavity nesters; avoid over-tidying.</li>
        <li><strong>Windbreaks:</strong> Hedges and layered planting reduce wind shear on bee flight lines and protect blooms.</li>
      </ul>

    </section>

    <section id="pesticides">
      <h2>Pesticides: avoid, reduce, and time correctly</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Avoid systemic insecticides on ornamentals:</strong> They can contaminate nectar/pollen for weeks to months.</li>
        <li><strong>IPM first:</strong> Choose resistant varieties, improve soil and airflow, hand-remove pests, and encourage beneficial insects.</li>
        <li><strong>If treatment is unavoidable:</strong> Spot-treat non-blooming plants at dusk, follow labels strictly, and avoid drift into blooms or water.</li>
      </ul>

    </section>

    <section id="templates">
      <h2>Ready-to-use design templates</h2>

      <h3>Small sunny border (approx. 3 × 1.5 m)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Back row (structure):</strong> Two flowering shrubs for mid-season nectar and screening.</li>
        <li><strong>Mid row (color blocks):</strong> Three clumps of long-blooming perennials with staggered flowering.</li>
        <li><strong>Front row (groundcover &amp; herbs):</strong> Low nectar plants and herbs that handle foot traffic and suppress weeds.</li>
        <li><strong>Pocket water dish:</strong> A shallow saucer with stones, tucked in partial shade.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Patio or balcony (containers)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Mix tall “thriller” perennials, mid-height herbs, and trailing groundcovers for bloom from spring to frost.</li>
        <li>Use lightweight planters with water reservoirs; rotate pots to chase sun.</li>
        <li>Provide a tiny water source; avoid fertilizers that push only foliage at the expense of blooms.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Apiary edge (wind-sheltered screen)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Layer a hedge of nectar-bearing shrubs, then a band of perennials, then a nectar groundcover “carpet.”</li>
        <li>Keep flight paths clear; place tallest elements to deflect wind and encourage bees to fly up and over paths.</li>
        <li>Integrate signage if public-facing to reduce disturbance.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="maintenance">
      <h2>Low-risk maintenance calendar</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Top-dress beds with compost; divide perennials as needed; add mulch sparingly and leave small bare patches for ground nesters.</li>
        <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Deadhead to extend bloom; prioritize hand weeding; irrigate deeply but infrequently to drive deep roots.</li>
        <li><strong>Autumn:</strong> Leave seed heads for wildlife and overwintering larvae; prune only what’s hazardous; plant late-season forage if climate permits.</li>
        <li><strong>Winter:</strong> Resist “clean sweeps”—many beneficial insects overwinter in stems and leaf litter. Do major tidy-ups just before spring growth.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="metrics">
      <h2>Measuring success</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bloom calendar:</strong> Keep a simple log of what’s in bloom each week; fill gaps the following season.</li>
        <li><strong>Visitor diversity:</strong> Note honey bees, bumble bees, solitary bees, butterflies, hoverflies—diversity usually indicates good floral structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Colony signals (optional):</strong> If you keep hives, correlate garden bloom with hive weight gain and temperament.</li>
      </ul>

    </section>

    <section id="mistakes">
      <h2>Common mistakes (and quick fixes)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>All bloom, one month:</strong> Stagger species to avoid a feast-then-famine curve.</li>
        <li><strong>Scattered singles:</strong> Consolidate into drifts—bees forage faster and you get stronger visual impact.</li>
        <li><strong>Over-mulching:</strong> Thick mulch smothers self-seeders and ground nesters. Leave pockets of bare soil.</li>
        <li><strong>Water bowls too deep:</strong> Add stones or cork so bees don’t drown.</li>
        <li><strong>Over-tidying in autumn:</strong> Leave stems and seed heads for overwintering insects; cut back in late winter.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="quick-start">
      <h2>Quick-start checklist</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Map sun, soil, wind, and existing plants.</li>
        <li>Choose three seasons of anchor plants, then fill gaps with herbs/groundcovers.</li>
        <li>Plant in drifts; add a shallow water source; leave nesting habitat.</li>
        <li>Skip systemics; use IPM; time any spot treatments at dusk on non-blooming plants.</li>
        <li>Track bloom weeks and pollinator visitors; adjust next season.</li>
      </ul>
