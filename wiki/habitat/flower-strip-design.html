    <section id="why-flower-strips">
      <h2>Why flower strips?</h2>
      <p>Flower strips are linear plantings—along beds, fences, paths, or field margins—designed to deliver nectar, pollen, and refuge through the whole growing season. They concentrate floral resources where bees can find them easily, improve crop pollination, support natural enemies of pests, and provide attractive, legible edges that are straightforward to service and mow.</p>

    <section id="design-objectives">
      <h2>Design objectives</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Continuous bloom:</strong> Early, mid, late-season flowers with overlapping windows.</li>
        <li><strong>Layered structure:</strong> A mix of heights (20–120&nbsp;cm) to handle wind, provide landing variety, and reduce lodging.</li>
        <li><strong>Foraging efficiency:</strong> Massed drifts of each species (1–3&nbsp;m blocks) so bees can work a patch without traveling far.</li>
        <li><strong>Low-input maintenance:</strong> Species adapted to your site to minimize irrigation and chemical inputs.</li>
        <li><strong>Access &amp; safety:</strong> Paths for inspection and a clear mow strip to prevent encroachment onto roads or crop rows.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="site-and-layout">
      <h2>Site &amp; layout</h2>
      <p><strong>Sun:</strong> Choose locations with ≥6 hours of sun; partial shade is acceptable for some spring ephemerals but reduces nectar volume.</p>
      <p><strong>Width:</strong> 0.8–1.2&nbsp;m for garden edges; 1.5–3&nbsp;m for field margins. Wider strips support more diversity but require more seed and maintenance.</p>
      <p><strong>Length:</strong> As long as your field allows; prioritize continuity so bees can “walk the strip.”</p>
      <p><strong>Buffers:</strong> Add a 30–60&nbsp;cm mown or mulched edge on the traffic side for neatness and to intercept weeds.</p>
      <p><strong>Wind:</strong> Where winds are strong, use a graded profile (short in front, taller species behind) or position the strip behind a hedge/fence.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="species-selection">
      <h2>Species selection: balanced, local, staggered</h2>
      <p>Choose locally adapted native or well-behaved non-invasive nectar sources. Build a palette with at least 8–12 species covering all seasons. Cluster each species in blocks so bees can exploit a resource efficiently.</p>

      <h3>Early season (colony buildup)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Willow, maple edges or early shrubs</strong> at nearby margins for pollen; not planted in the strip but influential.</li>
        <li><strong>Spring perennials &amp; bulbs</strong> at the cool end: integrate small patches near the strip’s start to bridge the early gap.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Mid season (peak demand)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Long-blooming perennials and herbs with reliable nectar and diverse corolla shapes (tubes, rays, disks) to serve many bee sizes.</li>
        <li>Include several composite flowers (daisy-type) plus spiked inflorescences for efficient handling.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Late season (winter-bee cohort)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Late-blooming species that hold through drought and shoulder seasons to support fat-body development in winter bees.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><em>Tip:</em> Avoid species with heavy double flowers that hide nectaries; choose single forms bees can access.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="mix-architecture">
      <h2>Mix architecture &amp; seeding rates</h2>
      <p>For <strong>pure wildflower mixes</strong> on prepared soil, typical drill seeding rates range from 3–6&nbsp;kg/ha (0.3–0.6&nbsp;g/m²) depending on seed size and species count. If using a <strong>forb-forward mix with 10–30% fine grasses</strong> for structure, aim for 6–9&nbsp;kg/ha total with grasses ≤30% by seed count to avoid choking flowers. Broadcast rates are ~25–50% higher than drill rates due to losses.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Composition:</strong> 10–12 forbs + 2–3 light, clump-forming grasses for lodging support.</li>
        <li><strong>Block planting:</strong> Instead of fully intermixed seed, consider sowing in repeating blocks (e.g., 3–5&nbsp;m sections) to create distinct foraging patches.</li>
        <li><strong>Seed carrier:</strong> Mix with clean sand/vermiculite for even distribution; sow half the amount in one direction, half perpendicular.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="establishment">
      <h2>Establishment protocol (ground-up)</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Weed reset:</strong> Smother or stale-seed for 2–4&nbsp;weeks. Where feasible, solarize or sheet mulch along edges prone to invasion.</li>
        <li><strong>Bed prep:</strong> Cultivate shallowly to preserve soil structure; rake to a fine, firm tilth—seeds need contact, not depth.</li>
        <li><strong>Sowing window:</strong> Spring after frost or late-summer/early-autumn for cool moisture. Avoid peak heat unless irrigation is reliable.</li>
        <li><strong>Seeding:</strong> Broadcast or drill shallow (&lt;5&nbsp;mm). <em>Do not bury small seed.</em> Roll/firm with a lawn roller for contact.</li>
        <li><strong>Moisture:</strong> Keep the top 1–2&nbsp;cm moist until germination. Drip or overhead is fine; avoid puddling.</li>
        <li><strong>Nurse cover (optional):</strong> A light nurse crop (e.g., sterile oats) can suppress early weeds and reduce erosion; mow before it shades seedlings.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="maintenance">
      <h2>Maintenance schedule</h2>
      <h3>Year 0–1 (establishment)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Weed management:</strong> Mow high (10–15&nbsp;cm) whenever weeds threaten to flower; this spares low-growing forbs while preventing seed set.</li>
        <li><strong>Irrigation:</strong> Water during extended dry spells to avoid seedling loss.</li>
        <li><strong>Gap fills:</strong> Spot-sow failed patches after the first season to maintain continuity.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Year 2–3 (maturation)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cutback:</strong> One or two cuts per year outside peak bloom (e.g., late winter). Remove thatch where it smothers rosettes.</li>
        <li><strong>Edge control:</strong> Maintain the mown strip; edge once per month in the growing season.</li>
        <li><strong>Selective edits:</strong> Thin over-dominant species; add late-season flowers if monitoring shows a September gap.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Beyond Year 3</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Renovation:</strong> Every 4–5 years, scalp-mow and overseed desired species to refresh diversity.</li>
        <li><strong>Soil health:</strong> Where soil is very poor, side-dress with compost in narrow bands between plant clumps rather than blanket fertilization.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="edges-and-access">
      <h2>Edges, paths, and signage</h2>
      <p>Define a clear edge on the traffic side with a low groundcover or mow line; inside the strip, include stepping stones or a 40–60&nbsp;cm inspection path every 10–15&nbsp;m for maintenance. In public or shared spaces, use small signs to explain the purpose and reduce well-meaning “tidying.”</p>
    </section>

    <section id="patterns">
      <h2>Three pattern templates</h2>

      <h3>1) Narrow urban verge (1&nbsp;m × 10&nbsp;m)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Alternating 1&nbsp;m blocks of 3–4 species to create visual rhythm and forage patches.</li>
        <li><strong>Care:</strong> Monthly edging; two high mows in Year 1 to suppress weeds; spot irrigation in heat waves.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2) Garden path border (1.2&nbsp;m × 15&nbsp;m)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Front row low spreaders, mid row long-blooming perennials, back row taller spires.</li>
        <li><strong>Care:</strong> Deadhead to extend bloom; leave seed heads for overwintering and birds until late winter.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3) Field margin (2–3&nbsp;m × 100&nbsp;m)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Repeating 3–5&nbsp;m modules with a stable backbone plus seasonal accents.</li>
        <li><strong>Care:</strong> Keep a 60&nbsp;cm mown service lane on the crop side; two off-season cuts per year; periodic overseeding.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="risk-management">
      <h2>Risk management &amp; pesticide interface</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Drift control:</strong> Position strips upwind of any pesticide applications; establish physical buffers where necessary.</li>
        <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Any unavoidable treatments nearby should occur at dusk, on non-blooming vegetation, with drift-reducing nozzles.</li>
        <li><strong>Weed borders:</strong> Use mechanical edging over herbicides; if spot-treating invasive perennials, shield adjacent blooms.</li>
      </ul>

    </section>

    <section id="monitoring">
      <h2>Monitoring success</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bloom chart:</strong> Record weekly bloom presence for each species; fill gaps next season.</li>
        <li><strong>Visitor log:</strong> Note honey bees vs. bumble/solitary bees and hoverflies; diverse visitors imply good flower shape diversity.</li>
        <li><strong>Maintenance time:</strong> Track labor hours; mature strips typically settle at low, predictable effort after Year 2.</li>
      </ul>

    </section>

    <section id="common-mistakes">
      <h2>Common mistakes (and fixes)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Too many grasses:</strong> Forb-poor mixes look tidy but starve pollinators. Cap grasses at ~30% of seeds.</li>
        <li><strong>One-month wonder:</strong> Over-weighting mid-summer bloom leaves spring/fall gaps. Build seasonal redundancy.</li>
        <li><strong>Scattered singles:</strong> Plant in blocks so bees aren’t burning energy hopscotching.</li>
        <li><strong>Over-mulching:</strong> Mulch smothers self-seeders and ground nesters; use living groundcovers and strategic bare patches.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="checklist">
      <h2>Quick-start checklist</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Pick a sunny margin with room for a mow strip and access path.</li>
        <li>Choose 8–12 adapted species covering spring–fall; plan 1–3&nbsp;m blocks.</li>
        <li>Prep, stale-seed weeds, sow shallow, and firm the seedbed.</li>
        <li>Mow high to suppress weeds in Year 1; irrigate in drought.</li>
        <li>Track bloom and visitors; overseed gaps; enjoy the show.</li>
      </ul>
