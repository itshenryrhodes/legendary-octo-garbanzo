      <h2>When should you feed sugar syrup?</h2>
      <p>
        Sugar syrup is a tool to prevent starvation, build comb, or stabilise colonies during forage gaps. It is not a substitute for good forage or suitable colony size. Consider feeding when:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stores are dangerously low:</strong> fewer than two frames of honey in a standard deep brood box, or light colonies by hefting.</li>
        <li><strong>Spring build-up:</strong> early expansion before consistent nectar flow, especially for new packages or splits.</li>
        <li><strong>Comb building:</strong> drawing foundation requires energy and steady carbohydrate intake.</li>
        <li><strong>Autumn top-up:</strong> ensuring adequate winter stores after a poor late flow.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Do not feed</strong> syrup during an active honey flow with supers on, as it risks adulterating harvests and encourages robbing.
      </p>

    <section id="ratios">
      <h2>Choosing a syrup ratio</h2>
      <p>Ratios are usually expressed by weight (sugar : water). Weighing is more accurate than volume measures.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1:1 (light syrup)</strong> — stimulates brood rearing and comb building; used in spring and for establishing packages and nucs.</li>
        <li><strong>2:1 (heavy syrup)</strong> — efficient for storing before winter; used in late summer and autumn to backfill comb quickly.</li>
        <li><strong>3:2</strong> — a compromise that dissolves easily while still storing well in cool weather.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note"><strong>Quick guide:</strong> For each litre of <em>finished</em> 1:1 syrup, mix ~0.5&nbsp;kg sugar with ~0.5&nbsp;kg water. For each litre of 2:1 syrup, mix ~0.67&nbsp;kg sugar with ~0.33&nbsp;kg water (by weight).</p>
    </section>

    <section id="sugar-type">
      <h2>Which sugar is safe?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Use:</strong> refined white granulated cane or beet sugar (sucrose). That’s the baseline, consistent and safe.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid:</strong> brown sugar, raw/turbinado, molasses, and syrups with flavorings—these can contain minerals and by-products that upset bee guts.</li>
        <li><strong>Be cautious with HFCS:</strong> composition varies and some formulations develop by-products when heated or stored; plain sucrose is a safer default.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="mixing">
      <h2>How to mix syrup safely</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Heat clean water until warm (<strong>not boiling</strong>). Very hot water dissolves sugar faster but avoid prolonged high heat.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and <strong>stir sugar into water</strong> (not water into sugar clouds) to prevent clumping.</li>
        <li>Stir until completely dissolved. Avoid caramelisation; overheating can form hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), which is harmful to bees.</li>
        <li>Let cool to room temperature. Fill clean, food-grade containers.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Optional: a very small amount of acid (e.g., a teaspoon of plain white vinegar per 4–5&nbsp;litres) helps invert a portion of sucrose and can reduce crystallisation. This is optional; <strong>do not</strong> add essential oils unless you understand safe rates and reasons.
      </p>
      <p class="note"><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Use clean buckets and utensils. Rinse with hot water after use and allow to dry to prevent fermentation and mould.</p>

    <section id="feeders">
      <h2>Feeder types and how to choose</h2>
      <p>
        Pick a feeder that fits your colony strength, weather, and robbing risk. Strong colonies handle large top feeders; small colonies benefit from modest internal feeders.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Top feeders (trough or pail under a cover):</strong> High capacity; minimal disturbance; good for heavy autumn feeding. Ensure tight seals to prevent leaks.</li>
        <li><strong>Frame feeders (division board):</strong> Fit inside a brood box; bees access via ladders/floats to reduce drowning. Refill carefully to avoid spills.</li>
        <li><strong>Jar/pail feeders over the inner cover:</strong> Invert jars with pin-prick holes; place over the feed hole with an empty box as a shell. Simple, cheap, and low robbing risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Baggie feeders:</strong> Fill heavy-duty zip bags with syrup, expel air, lay flat over top bars, and slit the top surface. Very low robbing risk; single-use.</li>
        <li><strong>Entrance feeders:</strong> Easy to monitor but <em>highest robbing risk</em> and vulnerable to temperature swings; best avoided during dearth.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Whatever you choose, <strong>do not spill</strong> syrup around the apiary. Wipe drips and feed late in the day to reduce forager excitement and robbing.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="how-much">
      <h2>How much to feed</h2>
      <p>
        Amounts depend on your goals and local forage. Examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>New package/nuc (spring):</strong> Maintain 1:1 syrup until the first brood box is largely drawn (80–90% of frames) and natural nectar is consistent.</li>
        <li><strong>Comb building:</strong> Offer steady 1:1 in moderate volumes (e.g., 1–2&nbsp;litres at a time) and replenish as consumed.</li>
        <li><strong>Autumn top-up:</strong> Heavy syrup in larger volumes (e.g., 3–5&nbsp;litres per refill) until target winter weight is reached.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Learn your target weights by lifting or with a luggage scale on hive handles. Record feed dates/amounts; it improves decisions each season.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="risks">
      <h2>Risks and how to avoid them</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Robbing:</strong> Feed internally, reduce entrances on small colonies, and avoid open feeding. Stop if you see fighting or bees piling at other hive entrances.</li>
        <li><strong>Fermentation/mould:</strong> Mix small batches you can use quickly; keep containers covered and cool. Discard sour or fizzy syrup.</li>
        <li><strong>Drowning:</strong> Use floats or ladders in frame feeders; ensure screens are tight on pail feeders; never leave open syrup.</li>
        <li><strong>Chilled brood:</strong> Feeding can drive brood rearing. Make sure weather and stores support any expansion you stimulate.</li>
        <li><strong>Honey adulteration:</strong> Remove or keep supers off any colony receiving syrup.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="seasonal">
      <h2>Seasonal playbook</h2>
      <h3>Late winter to spring</h3>
      <p>
        Use 1:1 to steady small or new colonies until forage resumes. Pair with pollen supplements only if natural pollen is scarce and mite levels are low. As nectar flows begin, taper off feeding to avoid backfilling the brood nest.
      </p>
      <h3>Summer dearth</h3>
      <p>
        Light, occasional feeds can stabilise brood if a flow collapses, but keep volumes modest to avoid triggering robbing and unnecessary brood during heat stress.
      </p>
      <h3>Autumn</h3>
      <p>
        Switch to 2:1 to store quickly. Feed larger volumes less often so bees can cap before temperatures drop. Ensure ventilation to reduce moisture as syrup ripens.
      </p>
      <h3>Winter</h3>
      <p>
        Liquid feed is risky in cold climates. Consider fondant/candy boards when temperatures prevent safe syrup use. If you must feed syrup, keep it warm and very close to the cluster using well-insulated setups.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="integration">
      <h2>Integrate feeding with overall management</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Varroa management:</strong> Confirm mite levels and treat appropriately. Stimulating brood under high mite loads makes problems worse.</li>
        <li><strong>Space management:</strong> Add frames/boxes as comb is drawn to prevent congestion and swarming.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutrition balance:</strong> Syrup provides carbohydrates only. Aim for diverse natural pollen; supplements are secondary and situational.</li>
        <li><strong>Weather and ventilation:</strong> Syrup adds moisture. Ensure adequate ventilation so bees can evaporate water and cap stores.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="troubleshooting">
      <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Bees ignore syrup.</dt>
        <dd>Check temperature (cold syrup is unattractive), move feeder closer to cluster, and ensure holes/mesh allow access. During strong flows, bees prefer nectar—feeding may be unnecessary.</dd>

        <dt>Rapid robbing after feeding.</dt>
        <dd>Stop feeding briefly, reduce entrances, switch to internal pail or baggie feeders, and feed at dusk to calm the yard.</dd>

        <dt>Syrup crystallises.</dt>
        <dd>Warm gently and stir. Consider 3:2 instead of 2:1, or add a very small acidifier when mixing to reduce crystallisation.</dd>

        <dt>Mould in feeders.</dt>
        <dd>Clean with hot water, dry thoroughly, and feed smaller volumes. Improve hive ventilation.</dd>
      </dl>
    </section>

    <section id="ethics">
      <h2>Good stewardship</h2>
      <p>
        Prioritise planting and habitat so colonies depend less on artificial feed. Use syrup purposefully: to prevent losses, build comb, or bridge predictable gaps. Keep clear records and review annually to reduce reliance on feeding over time.
      </p>
