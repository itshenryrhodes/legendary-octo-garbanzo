      <h2>What is supering and why it matters</h2>
      <p>
        A <em>super</em> is a hive box positioned above the brood nest to provide space for bees to store ripening nectar and capped honey. Supering at the right time prevents crowding in the brood chamber, reduces swarming pressure, and captures nectar flows efficiently. Correctly managed supers also keep comb straight and clean, simplify harvests, and protect brood nest stability.

    <section id="pre-checks">
      <h2>Pre-checks before you add a super</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Queenright and expanding</strong>: Verify eggs and open brood so you know the colony is growing steadily.</li>
        <li><strong>Brood box occupancy</strong>: Aim to add a super when ~70–80% of brood chamber frames are covered with bees and at least 6–7 frames contain brood/nectar/pollen.</li>
        <li><strong>Comb status</strong>: Confirm good comb alignment. Correct cross-comb before adding space.</li>
        <li><strong>Nectar flow</strong>: Local bloom and weather forecast suggest incoming nectar (or an imminent flow). If forage is poor, supering can increase heat loss without benefit.</li>
        <li><strong>Health</strong>: If you’re in treatment windows or see disease signs, address those first to avoid contaminating harvest supers.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="gear">
      <h2>Equipment choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Box size</strong>: Medium supers are common for honey (lighter to lift). Deeps hold more but are heavy. Shallows are lightest but require more boxes.</li>
        <li><strong>Frames</strong>: Drawn comb accelerates storage and reduces swarming. If using foundation, ensure proper spacing and starter strips to prevent burr comb.</li>
        <li><strong>Queen excluder (optional)</strong>: A metal or plastic grid that restricts the queen to brood boxes. Pros: cleaner harvest comb. Cons: if added too early, can slow bees from moving up. Many beekeepers place the super first, let bees move nectar up for a few days, then insert the excluder under it (“baiting” the super).</li>
        <li><strong>Inner cover and ventilation</strong>: Ensure adequate top ventilation during heavy flows to assist nectar drying without chilling the brood nest.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="timing">
      <h2>When to add the first super</h2>
      <p>
        Add your first super when the brood box is bustling (70–80% occupancy) and a nectar flow is starting or imminent. If you wait until every brood frame is fully covered and resources are packed, you risk triggering swarm preparation. Conversely, adding too early in cold or dearth conditions can slow growth and increase robbing risk.
      </p>
      <div class="callout tip">
        <strong>Tip:</strong> If you have one box of brood and bees are expanding fast, supering slightly <em>before</em> peak bloom provides headroom so foragers don’t “backfill” brood frames with nectar.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="step-by-step">
      <h2>Step-by-step: installing a super</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare frames</strong>: Use all frames—don’t leave gaps. If using foundation, alternate foundation next to drawn comb where available to guide straight building.</li>
        <li><strong>Open and assess</strong>: Smoke lightly, confirm brood pattern and space use. If significant cross-comb exists, fix it now.</li>
        <li><strong>(Optional) Bait the super</strong>: Move one frame of capped honey or heavy nectar from the top brood box <em>up</em> into the center of the super. Replace its original position with a drawn frame or foundation. This lures foragers upward.</li>
        <li><strong>Place the super</strong>: Set the super squarely on the top brood box. Ensure box faces are flush to prevent bee space issues and reduce propolis sealing in odd places.</li>
        <li><strong>(Optional) Excluder timing</strong>: If using an excluder, many beekeepers place it <em>after</em> bees have started working the super (1–3 days). If you’re not baiting or you need strict brood-free honey, install the excluder immediately beneath the super.</li>
        <li><strong>Reassemble and ventilate</strong>: Replace inner cover and lid. In humid conditions, consider a top entrance or slight shim for airflow to aid nectar drying.</li>
        <li><strong>Record it</strong>: Note date, box size, frame type, and any bait frame moves in your <a href="/wiki/operations/first-inspection-checklist.html">records</a>.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="how-many">
      <h2>How many supers and how fast to add more</h2>
      <p>
        During a strong flow, drawn comb can fill shockingly fast. Inspect weekly (or every 10–14 days in cooler regions) and add another super when the active super reaches ~60–70% coverage of bees and nectar. This keeps headroom ahead of the curve. If you’re starting with foundation, consider adding the next box only after most frames are visibly started to avoid uneven comb.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>“Pyramid” approach</strong>: As the top super nears 50–60% use, add a new super on top. Bees tend to work the uppermost box; keep the freshest space above the cluster.</li>
        <li><strong>Checkerboarding</strong>: Alternating drawn and empty comb in the super promotes straight building and discourages swarm pressure by breaking up honey bands.</li>
        <li><strong>Weight cues</strong>: If lifting lids shows noticeable heft increase week to week, be ready to add another super before frames are fully capped.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="excluder">
      <h2>Queen excluder: when it helps and when it hurts</h2>
      <p>
        Excluders keep brood out of harvest supers, making extraction cleaner. They can also slow movement if installed before bees adopt the upper box. To balance:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Install after baiting</strong> once bees are storing nectar above.</li>
        <li><strong>Ensure traffic flow</strong> with ample entrance and frame spacing; crowding below an excluder increases swarm pressure.</li>
        <li><strong>Comb age strategy</strong>: Keep dark brood comb below, reserve light, clean comb above. This alone often deters the queen from crossing up.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="special-cases">
      <h2>Special cases and hive styles</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Two-deep brood nests</strong>: Add the first super once the second deep is ~60–70% used and a flow has started. Many beekeepers run two deeps for wintering, then stack mediums above for honey.</li>
        <li><strong>Single-brood management</strong>: If running one deep or one medium as brood, you must be quicker to super to prevent backfilling and swarms.</li>
        <li><strong>Foundationless frames</strong>: Use comb guides and keep boxes level. Add supers in smaller increments (one at a time) to maintain straight comb.</li>
        <li><strong>High humidity or cool nights</strong>: Favor drawn comb; delay adding large volumes of foundation until nights are warmer to avoid chilling brood.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="harvest-readiness">
      <h2>Knowing when supers are ready to harvest</h2>
      <p>
        Honey is harvest-ready once it’s <em>ripe</em>: typically indicated by capping. A common practice is to pull frames that are at least ~80–90% capped. Alternatively, use a shake test—if nectar doesn’t sling out of an uncapped section, it’s close to ripe. Unripe honey risks fermentation and adds moisture to your crop.

    <section id="troubleshooting">
      <h2>Troubleshooting common problems</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Bees ignore the super</dt>
        <dd>Remove the excluder temporarily and bait with a frame of nectar or capped honey. Ensure a nectar flow is actually on; otherwise consider waiting or feeding <a href="/wiki/operations/feeding-sugar-syrup.html">light syrup</a> to stimulate drawing (not in harvest supers).</dd>

        <dt>Backfilling brood nest</dt>
        <dd>Super immediately and, if needed, rearrange to open laying space: place empty drawn frames adjacent to brood, keeping brood contiguous and warm. Swarm signs? Review <a href="/wiki/operations/swarm-signs-and-prevention.html">Swarm signs &amp; prevention</a>.</dd>

        <dt>Excess burr or cross-comb in supers</dt>
        <dd>Ensure frames are tight with proper spacing, keep hive level, and avoid adding too much empty foundation at once. Correct early; the longer you wait, the harder it gets.</dd>

        <dt>Honey in brood frames after harvest</dt>
        <dd>Reduce upper space, return wet supers briefly for cleanup, then remove. Keep winter configuration tight and suitable for your climate—see <a href="/wiki/operations/winter-prep-checklist.html">Winter prep checklist</a>.</dd>
      </dl>

    <section id="hygiene">
      <h2>Hygiene and contamination guardrails</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No treatments in harvest supers</strong>: Reserve miticides/antibiotics (where legal) for periods when honey supers are off the hive.</li>
        <li><strong>Comb rotation</strong>: Retire old, dark comb from honey supers periodically to reduce residues and improve honey quality.</li>
        <li><strong>Label and segregate</strong>: Mark frames/boxes used for brood versus honey to avoid accidental mixing.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="records">
      <h2>Metrics and record-keeping</h2>
      <p>
        Track super additions, box sizes, percent capped, and estimated weights by box. Correlate additions with local bloom (e.g., fruit trees, clover) to improve timing next season. Photos of frame faces provide quick visual history. Consistent notes make it easier to anticipate when to add space ahead of a big flow.
