    <section id="why">
      <h2>Why feed pollen supplements</h2>
      <p>
        Brood rearing depends on protein and lipids from pollen. In early spring, during summer dearths, or after prolonged bad weather, colonies may lack incoming pollen even if honey stores are adequate. A well-timed pollen supplement can sustain nurse bee glands, stabilise brood patterns, and help colonies recover from stress. It is a tool, not a crutch. Strong colonies on good forage do not need it, and overfeeding can stimulate brood beyond what nectar and temperatures can support.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Use when:</strong> frames show little fresh pollen, nurse bees look thin, or you see patchy brood with jelly shortages.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid when:</strong> forage is abundant and colonies are already expanding rapidly, or when mite loads are high and not under control.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="what">
      <h2>What is in a pollen supplement</h2>
      <p>
        Commercial patties and do-it-yourself mixes combine a protein source with sugars and micronutrients. Protein sources include defatted soya flour, brewer’s yeast, and proprietary blends. Many add lipids, vitamins, and minerals that mirror the profile of natural pollen. Sugar provides energy and makes the patty palatable and pliable. A little water or syrup sets the texture.
      </p>
      <p>
        Avoid animal proteins and flavourings. Do not add essential oils unless you know their safe rates and purpose. The aim is a simple, digestible source that bees recognise and consume readily.

    <section id="benefits-risks">
      <h2>Benefits and risks</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> maintains hypopharyngeal gland development, supports queen laying continuity, smooths transitions between bloom periods, and helps small colonies recover.</li>
        <li><strong>Risks:</strong> overstimulation can outpace nectar supply and weather, leading to chilled brood or starvation. Patties can attract small hive beetle in affected regions, and they can mould if too wet or if ventilation is poor.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="recipes">
      <h2>Practical recipes</h2>

      <h3>No-cook patty (starter)</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Mix <strong>1&nbsp;kg pollen substitute mix</strong> with <strong>500&nbsp;g icing sugar</strong>.</li>
        <li>Add <strong>200–300&nbsp;ml light syrup</strong> in small additions, kneading to a dough that does not stick to gloves.</li>
        <li>Press into 500&nbsp;g sheets about 1–1.5&nbsp;cm thick between parchment.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Higher protein patty (boost)</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Combine <strong>1&nbsp;kg high-protein substitute</strong> with <strong>700&nbsp;g icing sugar</strong> and <strong>20–30&nbsp;g brewer’s yeast</strong>.</li>
        <li>Add <strong>250–350&nbsp;ml 1:1 syrup</strong> to reach pliable patty consistency.</li>
        <li>Form into 300–500&nbsp;g pads. Use quickly or refrigerate sealed.</li>
      </ol>

      <p class="note"><strong>Tip:</strong> Drier patties keep better and mould less. If a patty feels tacky, dust both sides with a thin layer of icing sugar before installation.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="how-much">
      <h2>How much and how often</h2>
      <p>
        Match quantity to colony strength and season. Newcomers often overfeed. Use these guide rails and adjust as you learn your forage:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Small nucleus:</strong> 100–200&nbsp;g per placement, check weekly.</li>
        <li><strong>Single brood box:</strong> 250–400&nbsp;g per placement, replace when half eaten.</li>
        <li><strong>Large double brood:</strong> 400–600&nbsp;g per placement, split into two pads to increase access.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Early spring programmes run 2–4 weeks, ending once natural pollen arrives. In summer dearths, smaller top-ups keep nurse bees steady without driving excessive brood. Always monitor weight and nectar conditions alongside protein feeding.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="placement">
      <h2>Placement and installation</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Find the cluster centre:</strong> Gently pry the crown board on a mild day. Locate brood frames without pulling the nest apart.</li>
        <li><strong>Patty position:</strong> Lay the patty directly on top bars above open brood where nurse bees congregate. Cut slits in the parchment so bees can access from below.</li>
        <li><strong>Thin layers:</strong> Two thin pads spaced 10–15&nbsp;cm apart are eaten faster than one thick block and are less prone to mould.</li>
        <li><strong>Headspace and protection:</strong> Add a low rim if needed. Close up promptly to retain heat and scent.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        In small hive beetle areas, avoid placing large, wet patties. Use smaller, drier pads and replace more often. Traps and good sun exposure help keep beetle pressure down.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="timing">
      <h2>Timing it right</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Late winter to early spring:</strong> Begin cautiously when flights are possible and nectar remains scarce. Stop when natural pollen is coming in strongly.</li>
        <li><strong>Summer dearth:</strong> Provide small supplements during gaps between flows, especially for hives committed to brood rearing or making queens.</li>
        <li><strong>Autumn:</strong> Limited use if colonies are rebuilding after a poor summer, but avoid stimulating brood into cold snaps unless you can support them with feed and insulation.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="measurement">
      <h2>Measuring success</h2>
      <p>
        Look for steady jelly in open brood cells, creamy brood food under nurse bees, and uninterrupted brood patterns. Frames should show a ring of pollen around brood. If patties remain untouched for days, move them closer to the cluster, thin them, or reassess whether the colony actually needs protein.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Inspection cues:</strong> shiny royal jelly, even larval ages, few dry cells.</li>
        <li><strong>Weight/forage cues:</strong> stable hive weight, pollen pellets on returning foragers as natural sources resume.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="moisture">
      <h2>Moisture and hygiene</h2>
      <p>
        Excess moisture spoils patties and lowers intake. Keep ventilation balanced and consider a quilt box in cool periods. Store unused patties refrigerated and sealed to prevent fermentation. Discard mouldy or sour-smelling patties.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="integration">
      <h2>Integrating with your wider plan</h2>
      <p>
        Protein feeding does not fix underlying problems. Pair it with good stock, low mite levels, and adequate carbohydrate stores. If you are building queens or splits, synchronise small, frequent patties with the schedule so nurse bee populations peak when you need them.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mite management:</strong> confirm Varroa levels are controlled before stimulating brood, as more brood can mask or amplify mite growth.</li>
        <li><strong>Carbohydrates:</strong> ensure honey or syrup reserves match the brood you are promoting. Protein without energy is a dead end.</li>
        <li><strong>Space:</strong> add comb when the brood nest expands to prevent congestion and swarming later.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="troubleshooting">
      <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Bees ignore the patty.</dt>
        <dd>Warm slightly and thin it. Move directly over brood. Check that colonies actually need protein; heavy incoming pollen makes patties redundant.</dd>

        <dt>Patties going mouldy.</dt>
        <dd>Use drier mix, smaller pads, and improve ventilation. Avoid placing against wet inner covers.</dd>

        <dt>Brood outpaces resources.</dt>
        <dd>Reduce or stop patties. Ensure nectar or syrup is available. Consolidate brood if cold weather returns.</dd>

        <dt>Small hive beetle larvae found in patties.</dt>
        <dd>Switch to smaller portions, remove uneaten residue promptly, and deploy traps. Keep colonies strong and sunlit.</dd>
      </dl>

    <section id="ethics">
      <h2>Good stewardship</h2>
      <p>
        Natural, diverse pollen from forage beats any supplement. Planting for year-round bloom and reducing pesticide exposure should sit alongside any feeding plan. Use supplements sparingly and purposefully, and record dates and quantities so you can review what truly helped.
      </p>
