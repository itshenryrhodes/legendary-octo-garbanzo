    <section id="why">
      <h2>Why solid feed in winter?</h2>
      <p>
        In cold weather, bees form a cluster and may be unable to move across frames to reach distant honey stores. Liquid feed
        (sugar syrup) risks chilling bees and adding moisture to the hive. Solid feed—fondant, hard candy (“candy boards”),
        or even dry sugar—sits directly above the cluster and provides an emergency energy source with minimal moisture risk.
        Winter feeding is not a substitute for adequate autumn stores, but it can prevent starvation late in the season or after
        a prolonged cold snap.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Use when:</strong> a colony is light on stores, weather prevents syrup feeding, or spring forage is still weeks away.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid when:</strong> colonies have ample capped honey positioned above/around the cluster, or temperatures are warm enough for syrup and cleansing flights.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="options">
      <h2>Feeding options at a glance</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fondant patties:</strong> Soft, pliable sugar mass placed directly over the cluster; quick to deploy and easy for bees to consume.</li>
        <li><strong>Hard candy (candy board):</strong> Sugar cooked to firm stage and poured into a tray or rim; durable, tidy, and doubles as a moisture buffer.</li>
        <li><strong>Dry sugar (“mountain camp”):</strong> Granulated sugar poured on paper above the cluster; zero cooking, good emergency method, also absorbs moisture.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All three work. Choose based on available time, equipment, and how much moisture control you need. Candy boards provide the
        cleanest presentation and last longest; fondant is fastest; dry sugar is simplest.

    <section id="ingredients">
      <h2>Ingredients and additives</h2>
      <p>
        The core ingredient is white granulated sugar (sucrose). Avoid brown sugar, molasses, or raw sugar—these contain minerals
        that can cause dysentery. Additives are optional:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Acidifier (tiny amount):</strong> A few drops of lemon juice or a pinch of cream of tartar helps invert a fraction of sucrose, making it more palatable.</li>
        <li><strong>Pollen substitute:</strong> Small quantity mixed into fondant late winter can support brood rearing; use sparingly to avoid stimulating too early.</li>
        <li><strong>Electrolytes/minerals:</strong> Not required; bees obtain minerals from pollen and water. Keep recipes simple.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="recipes">
      <h2>Recipes</h2>

      <h3>Fondant (no-cook shortcut)</h3>
      <p><em>Best for quick deployment.</em></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Mix <strong>4 parts icing sugar (powdered sugar)</strong> with <strong>1 part light corn syrup or inverted sugar</strong>, plus a splash of water as needed.</li>
        <li>Knead until pliable, not sticky. If using plain granulated sugar, pulse-blend first to a finer texture.</li>
        <li>Form 1–2&nbsp;cm thick pads sized to the top bars area; place on parchment to prevent sticking.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Cooked fondant (classic)</h3>
      <p><em>Smoother texture; more durable than no-cook.</em></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Combine <strong>2.5&nbsp;kg sugar</strong> with <strong>600&nbsp;ml water</strong> and <strong>½&nbsp;teaspoon cream of tartar</strong> in a large pot.</li>
        <li>Heat gently, dissolve crystals, and boil to <strong>115–117&nbsp;°C</strong> (soft-ball stage). Use a candy thermometer; avoid scorching.</li>
        <li>Cool undisturbed to ~60&nbsp;°C, then beat until it turns opaque and plastic. Press into trays or parchment-lined slabs.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="note"><strong>Avoid high temperatures:</strong> Overheating sugar can form HMF (hydroxymethylfurfural), which is harmful to bees. Keep it below firm-ball range and do not caramelize.</p>

      <h3>Hard candy (candy board)</h3>
      <p><em>Long-lasting, tidy, doubles as moisture wick.</em></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Mix <strong>4&nbsp;kg sugar</strong> with <strong>1&nbsp;liter water</strong> and a dash of vinegar or lemon juice.</li>
        <li>Boil to <strong>118–121&nbsp;°C</strong> (firm-ball). Immediately pour into a rimmed board (an empty shim lined with hardware cloth).</li>
        <li>Let cure until solid. Provide one or more holes/channels so bees can access from cluster.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Dry sugar (mountain camp)</h3>
      <p><em>Fastest “no-cook” emergency option.</em></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Place a sheet of newspaper or parchment directly on top bars, slit small holes over cluster.</li>
        <li>Pour <strong>1–2&nbsp;kg</strong> granulated sugar onto the paper; lightly mist to crust the top.</li>
        <li>Install a rim (shim) to create headspace; close up with insulation and moisture control.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="install">
      <h2>Installation: step-by-step</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Choose a warm window:</strong> Midday, light wind. Work quickly to avoid chilling the cluster.</li>
        <li><strong>Crack the crown board gently:</strong> A minimal lift is enough—your goal is to place feed <em>directly above</em> the cluster.</li>
        <li><strong>Position feed:</strong> Fondant/candy slab on top bars over the densest area of bees. If using a candy board, ensure an access hole aligns over the cluster.</li>
        <li><strong>Headspace &amp; insulation:</strong> Add a 5–7&nbsp;cm rim to fit feed and install insulation above to reduce condensation.</li>
        <li><strong>Moisture control:</strong> Add an absorbent pad (wood shavings or towel) above the feed or use a ventilated top with a quilt box.</li>
        <li><strong>Close and strap:</strong> Reassemble quickly. In windy regions, tie-down straps help keep lids secure.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="how-much">
      <h2>How much to feed</h2>
      <p>
        Quantities depend on colony size, local winter length, and remaining stores. As a rule of thumb:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Initial placement:</strong> 1.0–2.5&nbsp;kg slab directly over the cluster.</li>
        <li><strong>Replenishment:</strong> Check every 2–4&nbsp;weeks on milder days; add another 1–2&nbsp;kg if the slab is nearly consumed.</li>
        <li><strong>Late winter/early spring:</strong> Consumption often increases with brood rearing—monitor more frequently.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Weighing hives (with a luggage scale or hive scale) complements visual checks. A sudden weight drop indicates heavy consumption or moisture loss—investigate promptly.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="placement">
      <h2>Placement tips that matter</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Direct access:</strong> Bees should not cross cold, empty comb to reach feed. Center the slab over the cluster.</li>
        <li><strong>Thin slabs, stacked:</strong> Two thinner slabs melt into the cluster more evenly than one very thick slab.</li>
        <li><strong>Paper barrier:</strong> A layer of parchment prevents sticking; bees chew through easily.</li>
        <li><strong>Entrance reduced:</strong> Keep the entrance small to conserve heat, but maintain some ventilation to remove moisture.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="moisture">
      <h2>Moisture management</h2>
      <p>
        Moisture—not cold—is a leading cause of winter losses. Warm, humid air rises, condenses on cold lids, and drips onto bees.
        Pair feeding with moisture control:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Quilt box or absorbent pad:</strong> Wood shavings in a breathable box soak condensation.</li>
        <li><strong>Upper vent:</strong> A small top entrance doubles as a vent. Avoid wide-open holes that create drafts.</li>
        <li><strong>Insulation:</strong> Rigid foam above the inner cover reduces condensation on the lid.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="safety">
      <h2>Safety and quality guardrails</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Avoid overheating sugar:</strong> Keep boiling temps within ranges indicated above to minimize HMF formation.</li>
        <li><strong>No flavorings or essential oils:</strong> Unnecessary in solid feed and may deter feeding or stress bees.</li>
        <li><strong>Clean equipment:</strong> Use food-grade containers; avoid aluminum pots that can pit with acidifiers.</li>
        <li><strong>Rodent &amp; ant proofing:</strong> Store prepared slabs in sealed bins; at the apiary, reduce entrances and keep stands clear.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="troubleshooting">
      <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Bees aren’t taking the fondant.</dt>
        <dd>Reposition directly over cluster, shave the slab thinner, or score the surface to expose more edges. Confirm colony is alive and clustered under the feed.</dd>

        <dt>Candy board sagging or cracking.</dt>
        <dd>Use hardware cloth or a thin mesh in the board to support the candy; allow a longer cure before installation.</dd>

        <dt>Excess moisture on the feed.</dt>
        <dd>Add an absorbent quilt and confirm an upper vent. Dry sugar methods help absorb moisture if it persists.</dd>

        <dt>Spring stimulative brood too early.</dt>
        <dd>Reduce protein additives; switch to plain sugar; ensure the hive remains well-insulated and shaded on warm days to avoid premature buildup.</dd>
      </dl>
    </section>

    <section id="seasonal">
      <h2>Seasonal timeline</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Late fall:</strong> Verify stores and position honey over the cluster. Prepare candy boards or fondant in advance.</li>
        <li><strong>Mid-winter:</strong> Quick checks on warm days; top up feed if slabs are thin. Avoid long inspections.</li>
        <li><strong>Late winter–early spring:</strong> Consumption rises with brood. Maintain a steady reserve until natural forage resumes.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="ethics">
      <h2>Good stewardship</h2>
      <p>
        Winter feeding supports colony welfare, but the best prevention is robust autumn prep: healthy queens, low mite loads,
        and adequate stores. Keep records of feeding dates and quantities so you can refine your fall management next year.
