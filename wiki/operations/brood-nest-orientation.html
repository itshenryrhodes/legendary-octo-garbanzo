    <section id="why-it-matters">
      <h2>Why brood nest orientation matters</h2>
      <p>The way frames are positioned in the brood chamber affects heat retention, queen movement, nurse bee efficiency, and traffic to food stores. Good orientation reduces chilled brood, helps prevent swarming pressure, and makes later manipulations—like adding supers or requeening—more predictable. Poor orientation, by contrast, forces bees to waste energy heating empty combs, isolates the queen, and can stall growth right when nectar flows begin.</p>

    <section id="anatomy">
      <h2>The natural brood pattern</h2>
      <p>In a healthy colony, brood occupies a <em>compact sphere</em> centered in the warmest part of the hive. Pollen typically arcs just outside the brood, with honey forming a crescent above and to the sides. Your goal is to keep this pattern intact, minimizing gaps of empty comb between brood areas and keeping cold, heavy honey frames to the outside where they act as insulation rather than obstacles.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Center:</strong> eggs, larvae, capped brood in contiguous frames.</li>
        <li><strong>Next ring:</strong> pollen frames (or frames with mixed pollen/nectar).</li>
        <li><strong>Outer ring/top:</strong> honey and empty drawn comb reserved for expansion.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="principles">
      <h2>Core principles</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Keep brood continuous.</strong> Avoid splitting brood frames with empty foundation or heavy honey barriers.</li>
        <li><strong>Place resources where nurses can reach them.</strong> Pollen should be adjacent to brood; nectar/honey should be above and to the sides.</li>
        <li><strong>Protect thermoregulation.</strong> Maintain a tight cluster footprint in cool weather; expand only as the bee population and night temperatures allow.</li>
        <li><strong>Use drawn comb for expansion.</strong> Interleave <em>drawn</em> comb at brood margins when building up. Insert bare foundation only where bees are drawing rapidly.</li>
        <li><strong>Rotate old comb out gradually.</strong> Replace darkest, oldest brood combs from the edges, not the center, to maintain brood continuity.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="equipment">
      <h2>Equipment notes</h2>
      <p>These guidelines assume movable-frame hives. In Langstroth equipment, orientation is primarily left-to-right within a box and up-down between boxes. In top-bar or long hives, orientation is linear along the bar run; keep brood in a compact block with stores to one or both ends. Bee space and frame spacing must be consistent so the queen can cross combs easily.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="setup-checklist">
      <h2>Quick orientation checklist</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify all frames containing brood; group them contiguously at the center of the brood chamber.</li>
        <li>Place 1–2 frames rich in pollen immediately adjacent to brood on either side.</li>
        <li>Position honey-dominant frames as outer insulation; reserve at least one drawn, lightly filled comb adjacent to the brood <em>on the warm side</em> for laying expansion.</li>
        <li>Move undrawn foundation away from the cold margins; use it above the brood (under a warm cap) or in the super where bees are drawing.</li>
        <li>Ensure the queen can traverse the brood area without crossing a cold honey wall or large gaps.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you’re just getting started, review <a href="/wiki/operations/first-inspection-checklist.html">First inspection checklist</a> and <a href="/wiki/operations/feeding-basics.html">Feeding basics</a> to verify the colony has enough young bees and resources to grow.</p>

    <section id="seasonal">
      <h2>Orientation by season</h2>

      <h3 id="spring">Spring buildup</h3>
      <p>As temperatures rise and the queen ramps up, rearrange frames to create a compact, fuel-rich brood sphere.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Center brood:</strong> gather frames with brood into the middle of the bottom brood box.</li>
        <li><strong>Pollen next:</strong> place pollen-laden frames just outside the brood cluster.</li>
        <li><strong>Drawn comb for expansion:</strong> insert a <em>single</em> drawn comb at the edge of brood on warm days to give the queen space. Avoid inserting bare foundation between brood frames in early spring.</li>
        <li><strong>Honey outside/top:</strong> keep heavier honey at the outer walls and above to reduce heat loss.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When brood covers 6–8 frames and nectar is coming in, prepare to add supers (see <a href="/wiki/operations/honey-supering.html">Adding Supers (Supering)</a>).</p>

      <h3 id="nectar-flow">Peak nectar flow</h3>
      <p>During flow, the queen needs a steady runway of open cells. Bees will backfill brood with nectar if the super space is late or restricted.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Relieve backfilling:</strong> place a super with drawn comb early. If you only have foundation, add two supers at once so the upper stays warm enough to draw.</li>
        <li><strong>Brood continuity:</strong> do not slice the brood area with honey frames. Keep a drawn comb adjacent to brood for eggs.</li>
        <li><strong>“Pyramid up” carefully:</strong> if running two brood boxes, you can move one frame of emerging brood up into the second box (center) to pull nurses upward, replacing the vacated spot with drawn comb. Keep brood frames touching brood frames—no gaps.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Proactive supering and orientation reduce swarm pressure (see <a href="/wiki/operations/swarm-signs-and-prevention.html">Swarm signs &amp; prevention</a>).</p>

      <h3 id="dearth">Summer dearth</h3>
      <p>When forage dips, bees can get defensive and brood rearing may contract.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pull empty foundation away from brood margins to reduce chilled open brood at night.</li>
        <li>Maintain pollen and light nectar adjacent to brood; consider targeted feeding if weight drops fast.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="autumn">Autumn consolidation</h3>
      <p>As colonies prepare for winter, consolidate brood into a tight center and ensure a honey cap is directly above.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Brood in the middle, pollen just outside, heavy honey to the sides and above.</li>
        <li>Remove or relocate undrawn foundation; bees will not draw it in the cold.</li>
        <li>Replace any black, failing brood combs from the <em>edges</em> only; keep the cluster intact.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="winter">Winter</h3>
      <p>Minimal disturbance. Do not break the cluster. Orientation at this point is about ensuring that the cluster can follow honey upward as it consumes stores, with adequate ventilation to prevent moisture problems (see planned <a href="/wiki/colony-health/ventilation-and-mold.html">Hive Ventilation and Mold Control</a>).</p>

    <section id="manipulations">
      <h2>Step-by-step manipulations</h2>

      <h3>1) Compacting a scattered nest</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Locate all frames with eggs/larvae/capped brood.</li>
        <li>Place them together in the center in an order that keeps similar-stage brood adjacent.</li>
        <li>Put a pollen frame on each side if available.</li>
        <li>Move heavy honey frames to the outside walls.</li>
        <li>Add one drawn comb at the warm side for expansion.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>2) Preventing honey walls</h3>
      <p>A honey wall is a barrier of nectar/honey that the queen avoids crossing. To dissolve it:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Lift the honey-laden frame outward by 1–2 positions.</li>
        <li>Slide a drawn, lightly used comb next to brood to reopen the laying runway.</li>
        <li>Super promptly so incoming nectar goes <em>up</em>, not into the brood box.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>3) Promoting upward expansion (“pyramiding”)</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Move a single frame of <em>emerging</em> brood (cappings dark, bees chewing out) into the center of the upper brood box.</li>
        <li>Replace the removed frame with drawn comb next to brood below.</li>
        <li>Ensure both brood groups remain contiguous with brood on either side—no isolation.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>4) Integrating new foundation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Never place bare foundation smack in the middle of brood during cool nights.</li>
        <li>Insert foundation one position outside the brood on warm spells or in the super where bees are actively drawing.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5) Gradual comb replacement</h3>
      <p>Rotate out the darkest, oldest brood combs from the outer edges during strong flow. Replace with new, <em>drawn</em> comb or foundation (if bees are drawing). Keep the brood sphere intact.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="special-cases">
      <h2>Special cases</h2>
      <h3>Packages and nucs</h3>
      <p>For packages, begin with foundation or starter strips and feed until several frames are drawn. Keep the developing brood together and give one drawn space at the warm edge once drawing is strong. For nucs, center the nuc’s brood frames and flank with drawn comb; add foundation only as bees cover 7–8 frames.</p>

      <h3>Drone frames</h3>
      <p>If you use a drone foundation frame for Varroa management (later cutout), place it near the brood edge where the queen will lay but where removing it won’t split the brood sphere.</p>

      <h3>Top-bar/long hives</h3>
      <p>Keep brood bars contiguous. Put pollen bars adjacent and honey bars beyond. Avoid leaving empty bars in the middle; add new bars to the warm side so combs are drawn straight and attached.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="diagnostics">
      <h2>Diagnosing orientation problems</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Patchy brood with empty gaps:</strong> likely brood frames separated by honey or undrawn foundation—recompact.</li>
        <li><strong>Backfilled brood area:</strong> supers added too late or too small—open space near brood and super promptly.</li>
        <li><strong>Chilled brood or slow growth:</strong> too much empty comb around brood in cool weather—tighten cluster, reduce volume if necessary.</li>
        <li><strong>Excess queen cups &amp; swarm cells:</strong> congestion and poor expansion path—improve orientation and add super space (see <a href="/wiki/operations/swarm-signs-and-prevention.html">Swarm signs &amp; prevention</a>).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="mistakes">
      <h2>Common mistakes to avoid</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Inserting foundation between brood frames early in spring, creating a cold gap.</li>
        <li>Leaving a solid honey barrier between brood groups.</li>
        <li>Rotating out central brood combs during active laying, fragmenting the nest.</li>
        <li>Neglecting to super on time, causing nectar to flood the brood area.</li>
        <li>Over-expanding volume during dearth, spreading bees too thin.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="workflow">
      <h2>Suggested workflow at inspections</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Skim the brood area, locate the edges, and sketch the pattern mentally.</li>
        <li>Check that pollen is adjacent and at least one drawn comb is available for eggs.</li>
        <li>Shift any honey barrier outward by one position; bring drawn comb to brood edge.</li>
        <li>Confirm adequate super space above to prevent backfilling.</li>
        <li>Note comb age and plan gradual edge replacements over the next two visits.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Pair this with structured notes (see planned <a href="/wiki/operations/record-keeping.html">Record-Keeping for Hives</a>) and seasonal cadence (see planned <a href="/wiki/operations/seasonal-inspection-schedule.html">Seasonal Inspection Checklist</a>).</p>
    </section>

    <section id="ethics-safety">
      <h2>Safety and colony-first ethics</h2>
      <p>Keep interventions minimal and purposeful. Always return frames in the same orientation (top/bottom, face) to protect open brood. Move frames with adhering bees, avoid exposing brood to wind, and pause manipulations if temperatures drop or bees become stressed. Good orientation is ultimately about enabling the bees’ own strengths, not fighting them.</p>
