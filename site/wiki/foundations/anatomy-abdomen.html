    <h1>Anatomy: abdomen (worker honey bee)</h1>
    <p class="lede">The abdomen is the worker’s workshop and pantry: digestion, wax production, pheromone signalling, stinging, respiration, and energy storage. Reading abdominal cues helps you judge colony health, age structure, and stress.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Segments:</strong> the abdomen is made of overlapping plates (tergites above, sternites below) joined by flexible membranes so the bee can bend, breathe, and sting.</li>
        <li><strong>Key systems:</strong> honey stomach &amp; gut, wax glands, fat body, pheromone glands, sting apparatus, and the tracheal system for gas exchange.</li>
        <li><strong>Beekeeper payoff:</strong> knowing what the abdomen does turns everyday inspection signs—scenting, fanning, swollen honey stomachs, wax building—into useful decisions.</li>
      </ul>

    </section>

    <section id="honey-stomach">
      <h2>Honey stomach (crop) &amp; midgut</h2>
      <p>Foragers carry nectar in a dedicated expandable sac called the <strong>honey stomach</strong> (crop), separate from the true digestive tract. A valve (the proventriculus) meters nectar forward to the <strong>midgut</strong> when the bee needs fuel, or keeps it in the crop for delivery to house bees on return.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>At the entrance:</strong> swollen abdomens on returning foragers often mean heavy nectar flow. Expect active nectar ripening and potential backfilling of brood if space is tight.</li>
        <li><strong>During dearth:</strong> fewer distended abdomens and more hovering, probing behaviour. Re-check <a href="/wiki/operations/feeding-basics.html">Feeding basics</a> and colony stores.</li>
        <li><strong>Propolis &amp; water:</strong> the crop can also carry water (for cooling and feeding brood) and plant resins (propolis), each with distinct forager behaviours and scents.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="digestive">
      <h2>Digestive tract &amp; waste handling</h2>
      <p>After the crop, the midgut digests bee food; the <strong>hindgut</strong> collects wastes. Workers hold wastes for long periods during cold weather, then take <em>cleansing flights</em> on warm days. Brown spotting inside the hive can indicate stress or disease, but a few spots near entrances after bad weather can be normal.</p>
      <p>Normal gut health depends on steady nectar/pollen intake and temperature stability. Keep inspections purposeful and brief to avoid chilling brood and disrupting foraging rhythms.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="fat-body">
      <h2>Fat body: fuel tank, immune hub, and protein store</h2>
      <p>The <strong>fat body</strong> is a spongy organ spread through the abdomen. It stores lipids, carbohydrates, and crucially proteins (as vitellogenin) that support immunity and brood food production.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Nurses vs. foragers:</strong> young nurses have richer fat bodies; as bees age and become foragers, reserves decline.</li>
        <li><strong>Winter bees:</strong> long-lived winter workers retain enlarged fat bodies. Management that ensures diverse pollen in late season helps create robust winter bees.</li>
        <li><strong>What to watch:</strong> if you see starving behaviour—bees headfirst in empty cells, light bees that “seem small”—act fast on feed and space. Check <a href="/wiki/operations/winter-prep-checklist.html">Winter prep checklist</a>.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="wax-glands">
      <h2>Wax glands &amp; comb building</h2>
      <p>On the undersides of abdominal segments IV–VII, workers have <strong>wax glands</strong> that secrete thin white scales when bees are well fed and the colony needs comb. House bees pick scales off with their legs and chew them before placing and sculpting.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Signals of build mode:</strong> white wax on top bars and fresh burr comb are friendly signs; add frames or super space before congestion sets in.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutrition link:</strong> wax production draws on carbohydrates and some proteins—steady syrup during build phases (<em>when appropriate</em>) supports clean, straight comb.</li>
        <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> warm boxes work the wax; avoid long open-hive periods that chill comb and slow building.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>See <a href="/wiki/operations/apiary-layout-basics.html">Apiary layout basics</a> for spacing and <a href="/wiki/operations/first-inspection-checklist.html">First inspection checklist</a> for handling new comb.</p>

    <section id="pheromones">
      <h2>Pheromone glands &amp; colony coordination</h2>
      <article id="nasonov">
        <h3>Nasonov gland (orientation &amp; recruitment)</h3>
        <p>At the tip of the abdomen, workers evert a small fan-shaped membrane and raise their abdomens while fanning. This exposes the <strong>Nasonov gland</strong> which releases an orientation scent used to rally nestmates to food, water, or the new nest site in swarms.</p>
        <p><strong>Keeper cue:</strong> lines of workers scenting at the entrance can signal return-to-home orientation after disturbance, water recruitment on hot days, or the colony regrouping after a shook swarm.</p>
      </article>
      <article id="alarm">
        <h3>Alarm pheromone (sting-associated)</h3>
        <p>When a worker stings, the sting apparatus remains, pumping venom and marking the site with an alarm scent that can attract more stings.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Smoke disrupts alarm odour detection briefly—use sparingly but promptly.</li>
          <li>After stings, avoid rubbing the spot near the hive; remove the sting <em>by scraping</em> to reduce venom injection.</li>
        </ul>

      <article id="queen-interaction">
        <h3>Queen–worker signalling</h3>
        <p>Worker abdomen behaviour—scenting, fanning, feeding—interplays with queen mandibular pheromone circulation through the colony. If you see restless milling with little fanning or scenting, check queen status and brood pattern alongside signs in <a href="/wiki/colony-health/queen-replacement-signs.html">Queen replacement signs</a>.</p>
      </article>
    </section>

    <section id="respiration">
      <h2>Breathing &amp; abdominal pumping</h2>
      <p>Bees breathe through <strong>spiracles</strong>—valved openings along the body—connected to an internal tracheal network. Abdominal pumping helps move air; during fanning lines you can often see rhythmic contractions.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Entrance observations:</strong> strong, steady pumping with fanning suggests active nectar ripening; ensure adequate super space to avoid backfilling brood.</li>
        <li><strong>Overheating signs:</strong> gaping tongues, widespread fanning, and bearding outside on hot afternoons—check shade, ventilation, and water availability.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="sting-apparatus">
      <h2>Sting apparatus (workers)</h2>
      <p>The worker sting is a barbed lancet connected to a venom sac and muscular pump. After a sting, the apparatus tears free and continues to inject venom—fatal to the worker. The abdomen’s flexibility and muscles drive aiming and penetration.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Minimise triggers:</strong> avoid crushing bees; use gentle, deliberate movements; keep hive odours clean (don’t lay frames on grass flowers that invite nectar robbing).</li>
        <li><strong>Protective behaviour vs. aggression:</strong> short-lived alarm responses near brood can be normal; sustained pursuit suggests queen issues, robbing, or weather pressure.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="reading-signs">
      <h2>Reading abdominal signs during inspection</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Many distended crops:</strong> heavy flow—add space, confirm open brood isn’t being backfilled; see <a href="/wiki/operations/swarm-signs-and-prevention.html">Swarm signs &amp; prevention</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Fresh white wax on top bars:</strong> colony in build mode—guide comb with correctly spaced frames.</li>
        <li><strong>Frequent scenting:</strong> orientation/recruitment after disturbance; ensure stable hive position and entrance reduces confusion.</li>
        <li><strong>Abnormal abdomens:</strong> shrunken, greasy, or distended abdomens on young bees can indicate disease or nutrition stress—cross-check with <a href="/wiki/colony-health/varroa-monitoring-schedule.html">Varroa monitoring</a> and stores.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="practical">
      <h2>Practical tips</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Work with intent:</strong> open only what you need; return covers quickly to conserve heat, water balance, and wax-working tempo.</li>
        <li><strong>Mind the entrance:</strong> don’t block returning foragers carrying full crops; keep the landing board clear during heavy flights.</li>
        <li><strong>Support nutrition:</strong> ensure pollen and carbohydrate availability during build and brood rearing; see <a href="/wiki/habitat/planting-for-pollinators.html">Planting for pollinators</a> and <a href="/wiki/operations/feeding-basics.html">Feeding basics</a>.</li>
