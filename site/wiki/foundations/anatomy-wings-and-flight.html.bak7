      Anatomy: wings &amp; flight
    </nav>
    <h1>Anatomy: wings &amp; flight (worker honey bee)</h1>
    <p class="lede">Honey bee flight is a coordinated system: paired wings that lock together, powerful thoracic muscles, and behaviours that use flight to ventilate, communicate, and navigate. Reading wing cues helps you judge colony strength, forage, and stress.</p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <section id="overview">
      <h2>Four wings that fly as two</h2>
      <p>Bees have two pairs of membranous wingsâ€”forewings (front) and hindwings (rear). During flight they function as a single aerodynamic surface because the hindwing hooks onto the forewing with a row of tiny <strong>hamuli</strong> (hooks). On the ground, the wings can decouple for folding and grooming.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Forewing:</strong> larger, carries most lift; vein network adds stiffness.</li>
        <li><strong>Hindwing:</strong> smaller, contributes lift and manoeuvrability; edges bear the hamuli.</li>
        <li><strong>Hamuli coupling:</strong> a zipper-like row of hooks that snaps the wings together before take-off.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Flight muscles live in the <a href="/wiki/foundations/anatomy-thorax.html">thorax</a>. They do not attach directly to the wings; instead, they deform the thorax box so the wings pivot like clever leversâ€”fast, efficient, and remarkably durable.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="muscles">
      <h2>How bees beat their wings</h2>
      <p>Two opposing indirect muscle sets power flight:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Dorsoventral (topâ€“bottom):</strong> when they contract, the thorax roof is pulled down and the wings pivot upward.</li>
        <li><strong>Dorsal-longitudinal (frontâ€“back):</strong> when they contract, the thorax elongates, popping the wing bases downward.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These muscles are <em>asynchronous</em>: one nerve signal can trigger multiple cycles, enabling very high wingbeat frequencies with modest energy use. Bees can modulate amplitude and frequency to hover, accelerate, or carry heavy nectar and pollen loads (see <a href="/wiki/foundations/anatomy-legs-and-pollen-baskets.html">Anatomy: legs &amp; pollen baskets</a>).</p>
    </section>

    <section id="aero">
      <h2>Aerodynamics in brief</h2>
      <p>Bee wings are thin, with flexible leading edges and veins that resist torsion. Rapid strokes create and shed vortices that maintain lift at low Reynolds numbers. The wingâ€™s angle of attack and stroke amplitude change with task: foragers use longer strokes at take-off and shorten them while cruising to conserve energy.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Load-lifting:</strong> bees increase stroke amplitude more than frequency when heavily laden.</li>
        <li><strong>Heatâ€“flight trade-off:</strong> on hot days, they reduce amplitude and increase fanning to avoid overheating (see <a href="/wiki/foundations/bee-communication.html">Bee communication</a> for fanning signals).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="behaviour">
      <h2>Wing behaviours you can read at the hive</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fanning at the entrance:</strong> workers line up and vibrate wings to ventilate, evaporate nectar, and broadcast the colonyâ€™s â€œhomeâ€ scent. The abdomen is often slightly raised and the Nasonov gland exposed.</li>
        <li><strong>Orientation flights:</strong> young bees make looping, face-the-hive flights in calm weather, often in the afternoon. Expect temporary â€œtrafficâ€ bursts without heavy pollen return; itâ€™s a sign of healthy population turnover.</li>
        <li><strong>Bearding &amp; fanning:</strong> in heat or high humidity, bees cluster outside while others fan inside. Combine this with an assessment of ventilation and box space (see <a href="/wiki/operations/first-inspection-checklist.html">First inspection checklist</a>).</li>
        <li><strong>Alarm posturing:</strong> agitated bees buzz with higher pitch and may raise abdomens while wings quiver. Work more gently or pause; review <a href="/wiki/operations/swarm-signs-and-prevention.html">swarm pressure</a> and nectar flow context.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="diagnostics">
      <h2>What wings can diagnose</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Frayed wing tips:</strong> older foragers; normal in high-flight seasons. A colony composed mostly of tattered-wing workers may be near forager-heavy demographics after a dearth or queen pause.</li>
        <li><strong>Deformed or crumpled wings on newly emerged bees:</strong> developmental issue; investigate brood health and varroa levels (cross-check with <a href="/wiki/colony-health/varroa-monitoring-schedule.html">Varroa monitoring schedule</a>).</li>
        <li><strong>Wet, matted wings near feeders:</strong> syrup spills; reduce drips (see <a href="/wiki/operations/feeding-basics.html">Feeding basics</a>).</li>
        <li><strong>Persistent heavy fanning at cool temperatures:</strong> moisture accumulation or ventilation constraints; check inner cover vents and crowded nectar processing.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="handling">
      <h2>Handling frames without wing damage</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Space before lift:</strong> use your <a href="/wiki/foundations/hive-tool-basics.html">hive tool</a> to create a gap; avoid dragging frame lugs that can pinch wings against box walls.</li>
        <li><strong>Rotate, donâ€™t scrape:</strong> pivot frames out and up; scraping edges along propolised walls can shear wings of bees riding the top bars.</li>
        <li><strong>Mind the put-back:</strong> lower frames slowly, letting bees move; a sudden drop traps wings between end bars and comb.</li>
        <li><strong>Limit smoke blasts:</strong> over-smoke drives bees to gorge and rush, increasing accidental wing pinches.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="navigation">
      <h2>Flight control &amp; navigation</h2>
      <p>Bees integrate wing feedback with visual flow, odour plumes, and the sunâ€™s position. Wing stroke changes stabilize body roll and yaw in gusts. Foragers learn landmarks during orientation flights and update routes (â€œtraplinesâ€) as floral resources shift.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Wind:</strong> moderate wind narrows flight corridors; place entrances away from prevailing gusts (see <a href="/wiki/operations/apiary-layout-basics.html">Apiary layout basics</a>).</li>
        <li><strong>Light &amp; contrast:</strong> light-coloured landing boards and clear flight paths reduce collisions and wing damage at busy entrances.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="ventilation">
      <h2>Wings as the hiveâ€™s fans</h2>
      <p>Fanning forms coordinated streams: entrance fanners pull air in or push it out depending on colony need. Inside, bees fan across nectar-rich frames to evaporate water and to maintain temperature for brood and ripening honey. Youâ€™ll often see rhythmic waves of fanning that intensify at dusk during heavy flows.</p>
      <p>Combine entrance observations with an internal check: glistening open nectar plus loud, even fan â€œwhite noiseâ€ usually signals strong ripening. Add space as needed to avoid congestion (see <a href="/wiki/operations/first-inspection-checklist.html">First inspection checklist</a>).</p>
    </section>

    <section id="seasonal">
      <h2>Seasonal patterns</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Spring build-up:</strong> rising orientation flights and brisk pollen flight. Expect increasing wing wear on foragers by late spring.</li>
        <li><strong>Summer main flow:</strong> sustained high traffic; long, steady take-offs and landings. Watch for bearding and intense evening fanning.</li>
        <li><strong>Late season:</strong> traffic shifts from pollen to nectar (or vice versa) depending on forage; wing wear peaks then declines as colonies contract.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="keeper-checks">
      <h2>Keeper quick checks at the entrance</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Count pollen loads versus empty landings over 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Note sound: a high, agitated buzz suggests alarm; a low, steady hum with fanning suggests nectar processing.</li>
        <li>Watch for orientation â€œcloudsâ€ in late afternoon on calm daysâ€”healthy sign of turnover.</li>
        <li>Glance for tattered wings concentrationsâ€”indicates age distribution.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="faq">
      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <p><strong>Do queens and drones fly differently?</strong> Yes. Drones have larger bodies and different wing loading; their flight looks heavier. Queens fly sparinglyâ€”mostly for mating or swarmingâ€”often escorted by workers.</p>
      <p><strong>Can bees fly in rain?</strong> Light drizzle sometimes; sustained rain grounds flights. After storms, you may see bursty traffic as foragers catch up.</p>
      <p><strong>What about clipped wings?</strong> Some beekeepers clip queens to reduce swarm loss. It doesnâ€™t affect worker flight but has management trade-offs better covered in an operations article.</p>
