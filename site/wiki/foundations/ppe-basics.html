  <section id="why-ppe">
    <h2>Why PPE matters</h2>
    <p>Protective clothing doesn’t make bees “safe”—your technique and timing do that. But PPE gives you a margin for error so you can stay calm, avoid stings to the face and hands, and keep working methodically when conditions are less than ideal (wind, dearth, queenless temperament, or your own inexperience). Calm beekeepers make calmer bees.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="core-kit">
    <h2>Core kit: veil, suit/jacket, gloves, footwear</h2>
    <div class="grid">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Veil</h3>
        <p>A veil is non-negotiable. A <strong>round or fencing-style veil</strong> that sits clear of your skin is best; mesh should be fine enough to stop stings yet airy for visibility. Ensure secure zips and overlap flaps where veil meets jacket/suit.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Suit vs jacket</h3>
        <p><strong>Full suits</strong> seal more reliably (fewer gaps) and protect legs when working in long grass. <strong>Jackets</strong> are cooler and faster to put on for quick checks. Either can be appropriate—choose based on your climate and work length.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Gloves</h3>
        <p><strong>Nitrile</strong> (with cuffs) give dexterity and can be changed between colonies for hygiene. <strong>Goatskin</strong> gloves are durable but transmit alarm odors; wash regularly. Beginners often prefer gloves until handling becomes gentle and precise.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Footwear</h3>
        <p>Closed-toe boots with smooth uppers are easy to brush bees off. Tuck trouser cuffs into socks or boots to prevent leg stings. Avoid dangling laces and thick perfumed socks.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="choosing">
    <h2>Choosing materials &amp; fit</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fabric:</strong> Medium-weight cotton or poly-cotton is common. In hot climates, ventilated or 3-layer mesh suits reduce heat stress while keeping space between bee and skin.</li>
      <li><strong>Color:</strong> Light, matte colors (white, khaki) are least provocative and don’t overheat as quickly as dark colors.</li>
      <li><strong>Fit:</strong> Slightly loose is safer—fabric should not rest against skin. Sleeves and ankles need secure elastic. Check torso length so bending doesn’t pull zips apart.</li>
      <li><strong>Closures:</strong> Look for YKK-type zips, double flaps over zip joins, and thumb loops to keep sleeves down when donning gloves.</li>
      <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Good mesh is worth it; replace scratched or bent veils promptly to avoid glare and blind spots.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="donning">
    <h2>Donning &amp; doffing: a safe routine</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Before opening a hive, put on your jacket/suit and close <em>every zip</em>. Check veil zip joins and pull the overlap flaps fully into place.</li>
      <li>Tuck trouser ends securely. Put on gloves last so cuffs overlap sleeves.</li>
      <li>After working, step away from flight paths. Brush or waft bees off your suit, then remove gloves and veil. Avoid leaving gear with alarm odor near open hives.</li>
      <li>Hang the suit to air out; don’t throw it in a hot car where wax and propolis can soften into zips.</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section id="when-to-wear">
    <h2>When to wear PPE (and when you can reduce it)</h2>
    <p>Match PPE to the job and conditions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Full PPE:</strong> First inspections, swarmy colonies, robbing/dearth periods, queenless colonies, or manipulations that compress bees (e.g., tight propolis).</li>
      <li><strong>Reduced PPE:</strong> Calm mid-flow inspections on gentle bees: jacket + veil; some experienced beekeepers use thin gloves or bare hands for delicate manipulations.</li>
      <li><strong>No-glove practice:</strong> If you try it, keep a pair within reach. The goal is gentler handling, not bravado.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Smoke technique still matters—review <a href="/wiki/foundations/smoker-basics.html">Smoker basics</a> and keep puffs minimal and well-timed.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="care">
    <h2>Cleaning, storage &amp; biosecurity</h2>
    <p>Clean PPE extends its life and reduces disease spread:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Suits/jackets:</strong> Cold pre-soak, then warm wash with mild detergent. Close zips, release veil frames if removable. Avoid bleach on mesh; line-dry.</li>
      <li><strong>Gloves:</strong> Wash nitrile between colonies or replace; launder leather with mild soap, rinse, air-dry flat, condition lightly.</li>
      <li><strong>Veils:</strong> Wipe salt/sweat from mesh and frames; store flat to prevent kinks.</li>
      <li><strong>Dedicated gear:</strong> If you assist other apiaries, use a dedicated set or disinfect between yards to reduce pathogen transmission.</li>
      <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Dry, ventilated space; seal away from mice and wasps. Keep a small “go bag” with spare nitrile gloves, tape, and a zip tie for emergency repairs.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="comfort">
    <h2>Heat, visibility &amp; mobility tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Hydrate before you start; take shade breaks. Ventilated suits or moisture-wicking base layers help in hot weather.</li>
      <li>Wear a cap under the veil to keep mesh off your face and reduce glare.</li>
      <li>Use slow, deliberate movements; avoid crushing bees in fabric folds.</li>
      <li>Keep hair tied back and jewelry minimal so nothing snags or traps bees.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="troubleshoot">
    <h2>Troubleshooting common issues</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Bees getting inside the veil</dt>
      <dd>Usually a gap at the veil zip join or a bent wire in the veil frame. Close fully; tape a gap as a temporary fix and repair/replace the veil.</dd>
      <dt>Stings through fabric</dt>
      <dd>Fabric is too tight to the skin, or saturated with alarm odor. Loosen fit, add a light base layer, and launder the suit.</dd>
      <dt>Hands too clumsy in gloves</dt>
      <dd>Switch to thinner nitrile with long cuffs or well-fitted goatskin. Practice slow frame lifts and rolling motions rather than pinches.</dd>
      <dt>Overheating</dt>
      <dd>Work earlier/later in the day, choose ventilated PPE, shorten sessions, and use shade. Prioritize hydration and rest.</dd>
