    <h1>Comb architecture basics</h1>
    <p class="lede">Comb is the colony’s living infrastructure: nursery, pantry, and walkway system. Reading its pattern helps you judge health, space, and next actions.</p>

    <section id="why-comb">
      <h2>Why comb matters</h2>
      <p>Comb stores brood, nectar, honey, and pollen; guides traffic and thermoregulation; and records the colony’s history. Good comb supports efficient inspections and healthy growth.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="cell-sizes">
      <h2>Cell sizes &amp; purposes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Worker cells (~5.2–5.4&nbsp;mm)</strong> — majority of brood area; compact, even capping when healthy.</li>
        <li><strong>Drone cells (~6.2–6.6&nbsp;mm)</strong> — larger, domed cappings; typically at frame edges or dedicated patches.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage cells</strong> — the same hexagons extended a little deeper for nectar/honey; pollen cells often rimmed with multicoloured granules (“bee bread”).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Foundation sheets bias size; natural (foundationless) comb shows more variation, especially early season.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="orientation">
      <h2>Orientation &amp; “bee space”</h2>
      <p>Bees keep a walkable gap (about 6–9&nbsp;mm) between comb faces. Too little: they propolise; too much: they add burr/bridge comb. Straight comb and consistent spacing make inspections faster and gentler.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="layout">
      <h2>Typical frame layout</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Center frames:</strong> worker brood with a pollen fringe and honey arc above (“rainbow frame”).</li>
        <li><strong>Outer frames:</strong> more nectar and capped honey, less brood.</li>
        <li><strong>Drone patches:</strong> at lower corners or edges, or on frames the colony has “chosen” for drones.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This pattern shifts with season and flow; heavy flows push nectar into brood areas until nurses reclaim cells after emergence.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="reading-comb">
      <h2>Reading comb quality</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Even brood pattern:</strong> few empty cells among capped worker brood suggests a well-mated queen.</li>
        <li><strong>Scattered brood (“shotgun”):</strong> consider queen age, nutrition, disease pressure; cross-check your <a href="/wiki/colony-health/varroa-monitoring-schedule.html">varroa counts</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Excess drone comb:</strong> fine in spring; persistent excess can hint at queen issues or mis-spaced frames.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross/bridge comb:</strong> indicates spacing or level issues; correcting early prevents chronic damage during inspections.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="management">
      <h2>Comb management basics</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Guide straight builds:</strong> keep frames tight together; use drawn comb as a ladder between new sheets.</li>
        <li><strong>Rotate dark comb out:</strong> old black comb (heavy, brittle) can harbor residues and spores; cycle a few frames out each season.</li>
        <li><strong>Add space at the right time:</strong> super before the main flow to prevent honey back-filling brood space (see <a href="/wiki/operations/swarm-signs-and-prevention.html">Swarm signs &amp; prevention</a>).</li>
        <li><strong>Fix cross comb early:</strong> on warm days, cut and press straight; secure with elastic bands if needed.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="natural-vs-foundation">
      <h2>Foundation vs foundationless</h2>
      <p><strong>Foundation:</strong> faster, straighter starts and predictable cell size; good for beginners. <strong>Foundationless:</strong> flexible, lighter equipment, and easy cut-comb; requires careful keeping frames plumb and tight.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="inspection-cues">
      <h2>Inspection cues</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fresh white comb:</strong> colony is in building mode; good time to expand.</li>
        <li><strong>Honey back-fill in brood nest:</strong> add space; check for swarm cues such as charged queen cups.</li>
        <li><strong>Uneven cappings or perforations:</strong> look for chilled brood, varroa damage, or hygienic removal (see <a href="/wiki/colony-health/hygienic-behaviour-testing.html">Hygienic behaviour testing</a>).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="handling">
      <h2>Handling to protect comb</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Work when comb is warm enough to flex without tearing.</li>
        <li>Lift frames vertically; don’t lever tight frames against soft comb faces.</li>
        <li>Keep propolis off top bars so frames seat squarely and maintain bee space.</li>
      </ul>
