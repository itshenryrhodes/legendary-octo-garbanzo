    <h1>Anatomy: thorax (worker honey bee)</h1>
    <p class="lede">The thorax is the engine room—housing the flight muscles, wings and coupling hooks, and the three pairs of legs that power foraging, comb work, and hive ventilation. Understanding it helps you read colony effort, age structure, and stress.</p>

    <section id="overview">
      <h2>Why the thorax matters to beekeepers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Flight &amp; foraging:</strong> wing condition and thoracic muscle heat tell you about nectar flow, bee age, and effort.</li>
        <li><strong>Pollen economy:</strong> hind-leg structures explain how bees collect and carry pollen pellets; watching baskets hints at forage diversity.</li>
        <li><strong>Ventilation &amp; temperature:</strong> thoracic muscles generate heat; wing-beating drives fanning and ripens nectar into honey.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Pair this with <a href="/wiki/foundations/anatomy-head.html">Anatomy: head</a> and <a href="/wiki/foundations/anatomy-abdomen.html">Anatomy: abdomen</a> for the full picture, and with behaviour in <a href="/wiki/foundations/bee-communication.html">Bee communication</a>.</p>

    <section id="layout">
      <h2>Layout: three segments, one engine block</h2>
      <p>The thorax has three fused segments—<strong>prothorax</strong>, <strong>mesothorax</strong>, and <strong>metathorax</strong>—armoured by plates of exoskeleton (sclerites). Inside is a dense mass of <strong>indirect flight muscles</strong> attached to the thoracic box rather than directly to the wings. When these muscles contract, they flex the thorax to move the wings at high frequency.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Prothorax:</strong> bears the forelegs; contributes to neck and shoulder mobility for head positioning during work.</li>
        <li><strong>Mesothorax:</strong> carries the forewings and the largest muscle blocks; most of the power lives here.</li>
        <li><strong>Metathorax:</strong> bears the hindwings and hindlegs; smaller but important for wing coupling and leg leverage.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="wings">
      <h2>Wings, hamuli &amp; flight</h2>
      <p>Bees have two pairs of wings. In flight, the <strong>hindwing hooks</strong> (<em>hamuli</em>) clip onto a fold of the forewing so each side acts like a single large wing, improving lift and control.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Wingbeats:</strong> rapid, with subtle amplitude and angle changes for steering. Bees can warm up by vibrating flight muscles without moving the wings—useful in cool weather.</li>
        <li><strong>Venation:</strong> the pattern of veins stiffens the wing and creates small windows (cells). While venation helps taxonomists, keepers mostly watch <strong>wing wear</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Wing wear:</strong> frayed wing tips indicate older foragers; a high fraction of worn wings suggests a strong, aging forager cohort or heavy traffic during a flow.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> if many workers show ragged wings plus backfilling of broodnest cells with nectar, add space (supering) to prevent congestion—see <a href="/wiki/operations/swarm-signs-and-prevention.html">Swarm signs &amp; prevention</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="legs">
      <h2>Legs: tools for work</h2>
      <p>Each thoracic segment bears a pair of legs adapted for different jobs. Together they provide sensors, brushes, and baskets for collecting pollen and grooming.</p>

      <article id="forelegs">
        <h3>Forelegs (cleaning &amp; sensing)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Antenna cleaners:</strong> a notch and spur form a ring that scrapes debris from antennae. During inspections, you’ll often see bees pulling each antenna through this ring.</li>
          <li><strong>Tarsal chemoreceptors:</strong> taste receptors on the feet help assess nectar sources and comb condition.</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <article id="midlegs">
        <h3>Midlegs (transfer &amp; brushing)</h3>
        <p>Midlegs brush pollen from the thorax and pack it backward. They also help steady the bee on vertical comb while the forelegs manipulate and the hindlegs load the baskets.</p>
      </article>

      <article id="hindlegs">
        <h3>Hindlegs (pollen baskets &amp; loading)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Corbicula (pollen basket):</strong> a smooth concavity on the outer tibia framed by stiff hairs holds compressed pollen. Bees add a bit of nectar to bind pellets.</li>
          <li><strong>Pecten &amp; auricle:</strong> a comb-like set of spines and a press help compact pollen into neat, sticky pellets.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Reading the baskets:</strong> pellet colour reveals plant sources; a range of colours on the landing board suggests diverse forage. Sustained monoculture colours for weeks may warrant supplemental nutrition planning.</p>

    <section id="muscle-heat">
      <h2>Heat, shivering &amp; ventilation</h2>
      <p>Honey bees regulate hive conditions with thoracic muscle heat and coordinated wing-beating. Workers can perform <strong>isometric contractions</strong> to generate warmth without flying, useful for warming brood or themselves before flights on cool mornings.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Brood heat:</strong> nurse bees press their thoraces against capped brood to keep temperatures stable for development.</li>
        <li><strong>Fanning:</strong> lines of workers at the entrance beat wings to move air, reduce humidity, and evaporate water from nectar during ripening.</li>
        <li><strong>Cooling water:</strong> water carriers spread droplets; fanners evaporate it, using the same thoracic power that drives flight.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> avoid long open-hive periods during cold or very humid weather—the colony will spend more energy on heat and drying. Work with purpose and re-cover boxes between steps (see <a href="/wiki/operations/first-inspection-checklist.html">First inspection checklist</a>).</p>
    </section>

    <section id="handling">
      <h2>Handling frames with thorax in mind</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Steady lifts, minimal jolts:</strong> indirect flight muscles are tuned to vibration; sharp knocks agitate bees quickly.</li>
        <li><strong>Light smoke, then wait:</strong> a small puff at the entrance and under the cover buys a short window of calm. Give it a few seconds to diffuse before pulling frames.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep traffic flowing:</strong> avoid blocking the entrance; returning foragers with heavy thoraces (warm from flight) are less tolerant of obstructions.</li>
        <li><strong>Return frames in order:</strong> maintain comb landmarks; bees orient by scent and structure as much as by sight.</li>
      </ol>

    <section id="inspection-cues">
      <h2>Inspection cues that involve the thorax</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Wing wear &amp; age:</strong> many ragged wings suggest an older forager cohort; expect turnover soon and monitor stores if a dearth is looming.</li>
        <li><strong>Fanning lines:</strong> strong fanning and a sharp honey scent indicate active nectar ripening; consider adding space to prevent backfilling.</li>
        <li><strong>Shivering clusters:</strong> bees on cool days vibrating thoraces near brood—normal thermoregulation, not necessarily distress.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="health">
      <h2>Health notes tied to wings &amp; flight</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Deformed wings:</strong> crumpled or undersized wings on emerging or young workers are a red flag. Review <a href="/wiki/colony-health/varroa-monitoring-schedule.html">Varroa monitoring schedule</a> and overall mite management, and reinforce nutrition if needed.</li>
        <li><strong>K-wing &amp; posture anomalies:</strong> sometimes seen after stress or exposure; confirm by watching behaviour rather than relying on a single photo.</li>
        <li><strong>Entrance pileups:</strong> if flight traffic collapses suddenly while weather is good, re-check queen status, stores, and signs of robbing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For systematic checks, see <a href="/wiki/colony-health/hygienic-behaviour-testing.html">Hygienic behaviour testing</a> and <a href="/wiki/operations/winter-prep-checklist.html">Winter prep checklist</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="skills">
      <h2>Skills to practice</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Watch landing boards:</strong> note pollen basket colours, wing wear, and the ratio of inbound to outbound traffic.</li>
        <li><strong>Feel box warmth:</strong> a gentle hand on the side wall can hint at internal activity; pair with sound and scent before opening.</li>
        <li><strong>Spot fanning rows:</strong> identify orientation versus ripening fanning (location, scent, and context help).</li>
      </ul>
