      <h1>Hornets at the Gate: An Unseen Siege on Our Hives</h1>

    <section class="post-body">
      <p>Across Europe and the UK, Vespa velutina has shifted from a warning on a poster to a fact of the season. It is not spectacle. It is patient predation at hive entrances and a slow drain on colony momentum. Treat it as a biosecurity problem that starts with fieldcraft and ends with coordination.</p>

      <h2>What the pressure looks like</h2>
      <p>Hornets hunt by hovering and intercepting forage bees. Every minute a colony spends in a defensive crouch is energy not spent on nectar, brood care, or winter preparation. You can see the behavioural change. Foragers hesitate on approach. Guards bunch at the entrance. Flight lines shorten. If that pressure holds, the colony enters winter lighter and exits spring later.</p>

      <h2>Identification in one glance</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Dark chocolate thorax and abdomen with a single narrow yellow band near the tip.</li>
        <li>Yellow legs that show clearly in flight.</li>
        <li>Smaller and darker than the native European hornet, which shows more yellow overall and a chestnut thorax.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Fix the image in memory so reporting can be confident and fast.</p>

      <h2>Why speed beats scale</h2>
      <p>The spread follows a familiar arc. Isolated finds. Local clusters. Overwintered queens and early nests. Delay favours the invader. Early detection and swift nest neutralisation are the only measures that change the curve. That demands three things that are simple but not easy. People who know what to look for. A reporting route that works. A response team that can act within hours, not weeks.</p>

      <h2>Practical actions for the season</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Watch the gates.</strong> Short observation sessions at peak activity reveal more than occasional long visits. A few minutes at several points in the day is enough to catch patterns.</li>
        <li><strong>Manage entrances with intent.</strong> Reduce entrances when pressure is visible to help guards without choking ventilation. Adjust again when the pressure drops.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep forage flowing.</strong> Stress compounds when colonies are hungry. Late nectar and water access matter. Small improvements in forage can offset defensive costs.</li>
        <li><strong>Report with precision.</strong> A photo, a time, and a location with coordinates if possible. Avoid vague notes. Clear inputs save hours for response teams.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid blanket trapping.</strong> Broad baits kill non targets and degrade the wider insect community. Use targeted measures only when directed by local authorities.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The systems view</h2>
      <p>Hornets exploit the same pathways that move our food and goods. They also benefit from longer warm autumns that extend hunting and nesting windows. Resilience is a stack. Borders that are alert. Local response units that are trained and equipped. A public that can identify, report, and then step back so professionals can find and deal with nests safely.</p>

      <h2>Research and monitoring priorities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fine scale distribution mapping.</strong> Consistent, open data on finds and nests to guide surveillance and predict spread.</li>
        <li><strong>Colony impact over winter.</strong> The real cost often appears after the headlines fade. Weight loss, late spring build up, and queen performance need tracking.</li>
        <li><strong>Targeted control methods.</strong> Tools that minimise non target impacts are essential. Precision beats volume every time.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Where Bee Planet Connection stands</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Back early detection with practical training and clear identification materials.</li>
        <li>Fund response units so verified reports lead to action within hours.</li>
        <li>Share data openly across borders so patterns are visible and resources go where they matter most.</li>
        <li>Prioritise methods that protect the wider insect community while dealing with the threat.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>None of this needs drama. It needs focus, good habits at the hive, and a system that moves at the pace of the season rather than the pace of paperwork. The sooner we normalise that, the quieter the hornet traffic at the gate next year.</p>
